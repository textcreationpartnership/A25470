         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And yet without ſo loving thee, how will there be kept any due proportion in loving thee, who doſt infinitely exceed all other lovely things? I ought to love thee infinitely as to the manner, though I cannot as to the act of my love,</hi> i. e. <hi>I ought to love thee finally for thy ſelf, or elſe I may love thee in ſome ſort infinitely, as to the Act, both intenſively and extenſively; in ſome ſort intenſively,</hi> i. e. <hi>more intenſely, more firmly, more ſtrongly then any finite good, becauſe I love them but for thee. In ſome ſort extenſively, by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46545:18"/> comparing all things, how many, or how great ſoever with thee, and loving thee before, &amp; above all, that I had rather all things in the world, and my ſelf too to have no being, then once to offend thee. But Lord thou loveſt thy friends in an unſpeakable manner more then they can love thee. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou great Lord, thou great Good, that fillest heaven and earth, why doeſt thou not fill my very little ſoul? O my ſoul that art ſo little, ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, why doſt thou not open all thy little doors? why doſt thou not extend thy utmoſt capacity, that thou mayeſt be wholly poſſeſt, wholly ſatiated, wholly raviſhed with the ſweetneſs of ſo great love: specially, ſeeing thou art ſo very little, yet nothing leſs will ſatisfie thee. O therefore my moſt loving God, I beſeech thee tell me what may moſt effectually draw out my love to thee, conſidering what prevention of love, what privative, poſitive good things I receive from thee, infinite in greatneſs, infinite in multitude: It is a wonder that any one can think of theſe things and not be wholly ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of love, wholly turned into love: But I ſee Lord, 'tis eaſier to ſpeak theſe things, and to write them down, than to do them. Thou therefore moſt good &amp; moſt powerful Lord to whom nothing is difficult, give I beſeech thee that I may more eaſily do theſe things in my heart, then utter them with my mouth: Open, I beſeech thee, thy moſt bountiful hand, and enable me, that nothing may be more eaſie, nothing more ſweet, nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, then moſt effectually, and moſt affectionately to fulfil that which I ſpeak about loving of thee. Lord give me leave a little to preſume above my hope, and to plead with thee about thy magnificent goodneſs: humane friendſhip will not give the repulſe to a poor, wanting, begging friend, O therefore moſt liberal Lord help me that I may love thee.</hi> Chriſtians 'tis worth while to make it your buſineſs to climb up to this love-extaſie.

            <p>I ſhall wave all thoſe great Truths and come to that which the words ſeem to import, <hi>viz.</hi> A power in man to turn himſelf. It is a good rule which <hi>Glaſſius</hi> in his Philologie gives us,<note place="margin">In Philol. l, <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>290.</hi>
               </note> That active Verbs are given to thoſe things which do not properly &amp; by immediate influxe, do that which they ſignifie, <hi>Sed certa tantum ratione concurrunt. God, ſaid to Moſes, Lift up thy rod ſtretch out thy hand over the ſea and divide it,</hi> Exod. 14.16. <hi>Moſes</hi> had not power to divide the ſea; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was a certain concurrence of <hi>Moſes</hi> uſing the rod accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to divine direction, therefore it is attributed unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it was the work of God alone, for verſ. 21. its ſaid, <hi>The Lord cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſea to go back.</hi> So in the work of Converſion, becauſe man doth ſomething about it, therefore he is ſaid to turn himſelf although the action be peculiar to the Lord,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.18.</note> 
               <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaith, <hi>Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Query here is, <hi>What can, or ought perſons to do towards their own Converſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Something firſt is to be ſpoken of mans <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>can;</hi> and then ſomething of what man ought to do.</p>
            <p>For the 1. of theſe: There is a threefold power conſiderable, an Active, a Paſſive, and an Obediential power.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An active power, as in fire there is ſuch a power to warm; in a good Tree there is ſuch a power to bring forth good fruit. This kind of power is denyed to be in man, Mat. 12.34. <hi>How can you that are evil ſpeak good things?</hi> if they cannot ſpeak good things; much leſs can they do good things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A paſſive <hi>power,</hi> as in Wax to receive the impreſſion of the Seal, and in wood to receive the engravings of the Carver. This power is not found in man:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith expreſly, The natural man, or <hi>ſouly</hi> man <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, receives not the things of the Spirit of God, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, neither can he. A ſtiffe dead hand receives nothing, neither can it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An obediential power, which conſiſts in a capability to receive what form or impreſſion ſoever the mighty God by his power ſhall put upon a creature, ſuch a power is in a ſtony heart to become fleſh, its capable to be made fleſhly when God puts forth his power. This is the power granted by Divines to be in men, and it is a very low power.</p>
            <p>The ſacred Writ is plentiful in ſetting out the impotency of man, it tels us that,</p>
            <p>He is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither can be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46545:21"/>
            <p>That he cannot pleaſe God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8.</p>
            <p>That he cannot come to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44.</p>
            <p>That he can do nothing without Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5.</p>
            <p>That he cannot believe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.39. <hi>chap.</hi> 5.44.</p>
            <p>That he cannot love God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20.</p>
            <p>That he cannot do good, yeild good fruit, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7 17.</p>
            <p>That he cannot think a good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>Mans liberty or power is referrible to Natural, Moral, or Spiritual things: To the firſt he hath great ſtrength: To the ſecond ſome: To the third none. A man freely doth natural and moral things, he can live ſoberly, and chaſtly, <hi>quoad externos actus,</hi> as to outward acts, he may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from groſs ſins, Theft, Murder Drunkenneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he may come to the Congregations freely, hear the word, and not ſtop his ears as the deaf Adder doth, but as to ſpiritual acts, <hi>qua tales,</hi> he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of the Querie, <hi>What perſons can do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their own Converſion,</hi> I ſhall lay down ſeveral Theſes or Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which I ſhall make good by Scripture as I proceed.</p>

            <p>Theſe <hi>Concluſions</hi> being laid down, I ſhall ſhew you what men can do towards their converſion: but firſt I muſt inform you that converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be taken two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Strictly for the infuſion of grace into the heart and will of man, whereby he is regenerate, and his will made good, here man and his will being meerly paſſive (for in this act <hi>voluntas nec eſt libera nec vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntaria</hi>) he can do nothing towards his owne converſion in this ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be taken <hi>pro tota ſerie auxiliorum quibus ad eam movemur.</hi> For all helps and means which further us that way; and in this ſenſe it's affirmed,</p>
            <p>That men may do much towards their converſion, they may mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially diſpoſe themſelves thereunto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They may do as much as heathens have done, or would have done, had they lived under the ſame means, and had ſuch motives, as they have. The Lord tells <hi>Ezek</hi> that <hi>if he had ſent him to a people of a ſtrange language;</hi> that was to the Gentiles, <hi>they would have hearkned unto him,</hi> Ezek. 3.6. <hi>they would have received him and obeyed his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> It is certified from the mouth of Chriſt, <hi>That if the mighty works done in Chorazin and Bethſaida, had been done in Tyre and Sydon, they would have repented,</hi> Matth. 11.21. And <hi>that the men of Niniveh ſhould riſe in judgement with the then preſent generation, and condemn it, becauſe they repented at the preaching of Jonas, and behold a greater than Jonas was there,</hi> Matth. 12.41. If one Sermon of <hi>Jonas</hi> who was one of the leſſer Prophets prevailed ſo much with Heathens, why ſhould not many Sermons of Chriſt, who is the chief of all the Prophets, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46545:24"/> as much, if not more with Chriſtians? <hi>vae torpori noſtro,</hi> what will become of us? <hi>Rahab</hi> ſhewed kindneſſe to the people of God, and that was antecedaneous to her converſion. <hi>Herod</hi> heard the Word gladly, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.20. And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deſired the prayers of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Exod. 8.28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They may ſit under a powerfull Miniſtry, coming with reverence before God, not offering the ſacrifice of fools, but hear the Truth without being contentious againſt it as they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8. They may let the Truth have a full ſtroak at them and their corruptions, <hi>They may receive the love of the truth,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.10. <hi>and not hold it in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 1.18. So that they will not ſuffer it to have influence into their affections, and to break out into action.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They may hearken to the voyce of Gods judgements and rods, when they are abroad upon themſelves and others. No man ſhould deſpiſe the chaſtiſement of the Lord, but every one ſhould heare the voice of the Rod, and who hath appointed it. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Chap. 16.9.</note> 
               <hi>That the inhabitants of the world will learn righteouſneſs, when the judgements of the Lord are in the earth.</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> His judgements are the beſt Schoolmaſters, and teach many good leſſons. <hi>Waldus</hi> was taught by the hand of God upon one of his ſociates to become a new man. When <hi>Manaſſes</hi> was in affliction, he beſought the Lord, and humbled himſelf greatly, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12. <hi>Vexatio dat intellectum,</hi> when the Lord doth box and buffet us with his judgements, our underſtandings are opened and fear falls upon us: and though this fear be ſervile at firſt, yet it may end in filiall, the ſpirit of bondage may become the ſpirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They may obſerve the difference is made in mens lives after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from that which was before. Converſion is a ſtrange worke, it makes a man another man. They in <hi>Peter</hi> thought it a ſtrange thing that men left their old courſes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ego non ſum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi> 1 Pet. 4.4.</note> In converſion Wolves are made Lambs, and perſecuters Preachers. How was it, that when <hi>Paul</hi> preached, <hi>all that heard him were amazed, and ſaid, is not this he which deſtroyed them who call'd on this name in Jeruſalem, and came hither for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that he might bring them bound unto the chief Prieſts?</hi> True, it was <hi>he unconverted</hi> did ſo, not <hi>he converted,</hi> now he was another, a new man, now he was a Chriſtian, and had other principles and practices than before; there was a great change wrought in him, and ſo in <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> Obſervation of ſuch examples have their uſe and energy:<note place="margin">Praecepta docent &amp; ducunt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empla trahunt.</note> For Examples are ſtrong traces to draw men from wicked practices. <hi>Why compelleſt thou the Gentiles to live as the Jewes,</hi> ſaid
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46545:24"/> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> Gal. 2.14, <hi>Peters</hi> example was the compulſion. There is a kind of compulſion in examples, not violent, but alluring and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting. The example of the believing wife may win the unbelieving husband, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. A prudent gracious Wife gains much upon a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Husband, by her modeſty and obedience.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They may ſee what equity there is, that they ſhould ſerve the Lord being his creatures, and ſervants, and not onely ſerve him, but ſo ſerve him as they have ſerved their ſinfull luſts, and ſomething more, ſeeing they depend on him. <hi>I ſpeake after the manner of men,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6.19. It's rationall, juſt and equall, that as you <hi>have yielded your members ſervants to uncleanneſs,</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> &amp;c. ſo now yield them <hi>ſervants to righteouſneſſe, unto holineſſe,</hi> it's reaſon, juſtice, and equity that you ſhould do ſo. Should not men take as much pains for heaven, as for hell, for their ſoules as for their bodies, for the Lord Chriſt as for creatures? ſhould they not be as diligent to weaken their luſts as they have been to ſtrengthen them? ſhould they not be at as much coſt to maintain the pure worſhip of God, as the inventions and traditions of men? It's a complaint of the Lords,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.2.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore do yee ſpend money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatiſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not?</hi> They might have ſpent their money, labour, time, and ſtrength, and as much for true bread which would have fed their ſouls, as they did for that which was, as no bread,<note place="margin">Luke 15.16.</note> but rather huskes for ſwine.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They may remove and abate ſin in part, which is done by the contrary. Knowledge removes ignorance as light doth darkneſs, grief abates pleaſure, and fear boldneſſe in ſinning: Patience keeps under paſſion, and faſting tames unruly luſts. When the ſtrength of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is abated by phyſicall meanes, a man is diſpoſed towards health: and when a man hath gotten Moralities (which he may do) and by them made an abatement of his ſins and luſts, he is <hi>materially</hi> diſpoſed to grace; as the ground when plowed is for ſeed, though the ſeed be not yet ſown.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They may do <hi>materially</hi> what Converts do. There is no act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in its meer nature and kind, which a true Chriſtian may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, but one unconverted may perform alſo, and have many like diſpoſitions unto thoſe they have.

            <p>To come more particularly and cloſely to the queſtion. Though Converſion be wrought in an inſtant, yet men have ſome praevious diſpoſitions thereunto, who live under the ſound of the Goſpel, and obtain ſuch knowledge as worketh in them ſeveral things, which I ſhall ſhew unto you from <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, <hi>&amp;</hi> 38. <hi>v.

               </gap>ſpoſitions or qualifications they had unto repentance or converſion, but they had not yet repented; for <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, notwithſtanding theſe, <hi>repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Men may be convinced of ſin as theſe were, they found they had tranſgreſſed the law of God, and were guilty before him, for they were pricked in their hearts. Men may have ſtrong convictions of ſin, and not converted from ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They may mourn for ſin, and grieve that they have done ſuch and ſuch things. Theſe men had crucified the Lord Chriſt, put an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon to death,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> ſaw themſelves in an ill condition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon mourned and grieved ſorely, as the word <hi>pricked</hi> intimates; they had ſuch grief as pained and afflicted their hearts. There's a <hi>How</hi> ſet upon <hi>Ahabs</hi> humiliation by the Lord himſelf: <hi>Seeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelf,</hi> 1 King 21.29.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They may be fil'd with fear, and dread the threatnings and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God due to ſin. This was the caſe here; they had provoked the Lord againſt their ſoules, felt their conſciences condemning of them, apprehended the judgements of God near unto them, and ſo were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with much fear leſt the Lord ſhould deſtroy them, and therefore ſay, <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> We know not whither to go, where to hide our ſelves, or what to do, that we may eſcape the things we have deſerved, and fear.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They may confeſſe their ſin, renounce it, and reform much; theſe Auditors of <hi>Peter</hi> being pricked in their hearts, ſaid, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> We have ſinned, and that greatly, we confeſſe and acknowledge it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and you, it was a curſed act of ours, &amp; we abhor it, we will never do ſo hereafter. They were ſick of ſin, and vomited it up, as they in <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.22.</note> and would change their minds and manners, &amp; walke in any way the Apoſtles ſhould direct them. <hi>The Merchant,</hi> Mat. 13.46. <hi>ſold all that he had for the pearle before he bought it.</hi> This ſelling all is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46545:26"/> made by ſom Interpreters to be his reſtraint from all inward ſin, and his conformity to all outward duties. This was much, and yet not more than unconverted perſons may attain unto. <hi>Herod</hi> reformed many things, the fooliſh Virgins went far, as was ſaid before, they were Virgins free from ſpot and pollution, they had Lamps, viſible profeſſions, <hi>they went forth to meet the Bridegroom;</hi> they had ſome faith in him, and affection to him, elſe they would not have gone forth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They may juſtifie the Law and the Lord; ſhould he condemn them, deal ſeverely with them; what ſhall we do ſay theſe perſons? we are guilty, we have broken the Law, which is holy, righteous, and good, and ſo is God likewiſe, who is the Author thereof, if therefore we be condemned, and muſt bear the curſe and puniſhment of the law, we muſt both juſtifie the Lord and it. Men may accept the puniſhment of their iniquity, and juſtifie the inflictors thereof, man hath no cauſe to complain of the puniſhment of his ſins. It's brought in by way of objurgation;<note place="margin">Lam. 3.39.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore doth a living man complain for the puniſhment of his ſins?</hi> He may complain of his ſins, not of his puniſhment. Many Malefactors after ſentence paſſed on them, do juſtifie both Judge and Law.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Men may ſeriouſly conſider the nature of their ſin, what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it is cloathed with, what aggravations it admits, what crimſon and skarlet is in it; what light, love, mercies, means, ingagements it is againſt. What ſhall we do ſay theſe troubled ſouls? We have ſinned againſt the light of nature, the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> our own conſciences, the love of God and Chriſt towards ſinners, in that we have crucified Chriſt a man approved of God, whom we knew had done many miracles, wonders and ſignes, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.22. and deſerve not death, oh what ſhall we do, our ſins are ſo dreadful?</p>
            <p>It's in mens power to lay to heart what wrong an infinite bleſſed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God hath by their ſins, what mercies they keep from them, how greatly they defile them, what miſeries and miſchiefs they bring upon them, what a weight of wrath hangs over their heads for them. They may conſider what checks of conſcience they have ſtifled, what motions of the Spirit they have withſtood, what precious ſeaſons of grace they have neglected and ſlighted, what paines they have taken to ſatisfie a luſt, how dear it hath coſt them, how careleſſe they have been of their ſoules, what a ſeparation their ſins have made between God and them. They may mind and meditate on it, that mans life is ſhort, <hi>the pleaſures of ſin but for a ſeaſon,</hi> that there is abſolute neceſſity of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to God: <hi>Except you repent, you ſhall all periſh.</hi> That turning is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46545:27"/> to God, elſe he would not call for it, nor make ſuch gracious promiſes to it, as are in holy Writ.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They may come to it, to ſee no help in themſelves or in any creature whatſoever, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> ſay theſe wounded men, we cannot help our ſelves, we have no playſters that will ſtick, no medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which will heal; we are wounded in our Conſciences, and as our hands, ſo theirs are too ſhort to help us; its not in humane power to bind up our breaches, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> men may ſee themſelves helpleſs, that they are without ſtrength, ſhut up under ſin, guilt and unbelief, children of wrath, and in a loſt condition, the Law curſing them and ſentencing them to ſuffer.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They may arrive to a reſolution of doing or ſuffering any thing to be ſaved: <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> we are reſolved if we may find mercy, <hi>and live,</hi> to do whatever ſhall be commanded, to ſuffer whatever ſhall be impoſed. The pride of their ſpirits was broken, their hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come teachable and tractable, and their reſolutions high for any thing to be done or ſuffered, ſo was it with the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30. when men are in ſtorms at ſea, or on their ſick beds at home, they reſolve if God will ſpare them, to do or ſuffer any thing for God and his ways, and their own ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="9">9. They may cnoceive fair hopes of mercy. The Lord Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held out in the Goſpel, and freely offer'd to ſinners, this breeds hope in them, a <hi>general</hi> and <hi>preparatory</hi> hope: <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> you told us that God had raiſed up that Jeſus we crucified, and made him Lord and Chriſt; and that whoſoever ſhould call upon his name ſhould be ſaved, therefore we hope there is mercy for us. Thus had they a hope kindled in them,<note place="margin">Act. 2.21.</note> and <hi>Peter</hi> in the two next verſes ſtrengthens their hope, ſaying, <hi>Repent and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and the promiſe is to you and to your children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. They may thirſt after, and pray for the mercy hoped for. Such a qualification was in theſe men, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> you men of God we are a thirſt, and do intreat you to tell us where we may have water to quench our heat, mercy to pardon our ſins, balme to cure our wounds. The Publican in <hi>Luke</hi> hath left us his ſhort pithy and affectionate pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to imitate being in this caſe and ſtate, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> He was ſenſible of his ſin and of his want of righteouſneſs, he had hope of mercy, and thereupon came to the Temple to pray; and pray'd earneſtly for mercie, and Converſion is none of the leaſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, or leaſt needful for a ſinner.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Men being come thus far, they are to wait upon God for doing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46545:27"/> the work: when the pots were fil'd with water, the water was not made Wine, till Chriſt put forth his mighty power; neither were the men who lay at the pool of <hi>Betheſdah</hi> cur'd, till the Angel came down and ſtirred the waters: ſo a man in this caſe is to wait until the Spirit of the Lord come in, <hi>&amp; omnipotenti ſua vitate,</hi> or <hi>victrici delectatione</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome his will, and ſet it for the Lord, and ſpiritual things: when this is, the work is done, and done without violence to the will; for its an omnipotent preſence prevails with the will, and its immediately made willing in the day of this power.</p>
            <p>By theſe forementioned things men are in a proximity or nextneſs to Converſion, but not converted. It muſt be an higher power then our own, which lifts us up into an higher nature or ſtate then we are in at preſent. Though men may do much upon moral perſwaſions: yet not ſo much as to make themſelves Converts, or ſpiritual, of Animal or Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Previous actions and preparative diſpoſitions, may make a man a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a Convert, not a true or living Convert.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewn what perſons can, and may do towards their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it remains to declare what they ought to do.</p>
            <p>The word muſt or ought, the ſignification of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Greek imports two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Neceſſity, there muſt be Hereſies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. its no mans duty to broach or bring in Hereſies, but they muſt be, its neceſſary for the diſcovery of men approved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Duty, God is a Spirit, and muſt be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth, its mens duty ſo to do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. It was the Phariſees and Scribes duty to pay tythe of Mint, Aniſe and Cummin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Theſe things ought they to have done, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 23.23.</p>
            <p>Now then what perſons can do, they ought to do: Firſt there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, we muſt do what we can; elſe we are ſloathful and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and our damnation will be juſt, one thing is neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> to turn unto God that our ſouls may be ſaved, here it will hold good, Turn or burn; if it be neceſſary to prevent burning in everlaſting flames, its neceſſary to turn, and ſo to do the utmoſt we can towards the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, its our duty; Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, ſaith Chriſt, he commands it and lays this injunction upon all, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſtrain, be in an agony, as Chriſt was in the work of mans redemption, ſo let men be in the works of their Converſion, put forth themſelves as they did in the Olympick Games, the Wreſtlers and Runners exerted all their might to obtain, and ſo muſt men about the work of their Converſion. The Lord who hath no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, ſaith, <hi>Turn your ſelves and live.</hi> There is life in turning, and what ſhould not men do to preſerve or obtain life?</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:46545:28"/>
            <p>The Lord hath two great ends in ſaying thus: <hi>Turn your ſelves and live yee,</hi> although he know man is not able to do it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we may ſee how corrupt and impotent our nature is, and ſo break the ſtrength of humane confidence thereby,<note place="margin">Quicquid nobis praecipitur a deo, ad illud facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem potentiam habemus.

               </note> and bring us to be ſenſible of, and throughly to bewayl our condition. It is not ſo as ſome think and ſpeak, <hi>viz.</hi> that whatever God commands, man hath power to do: what man ever kept the Law ſince the fall of <hi>Adam?</hi> and is not the Law given by way of command? if man could keep the Law, we might be juſtified and have life by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. but the Law can neither do the one nor the other, and why? becauſe man hath not power or ſtrength to keep it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To put us upon looking out for help from whence the command cometh. Hence is it that what the Lord commandeth us to do in one place, he promiſeth to give in another, <hi>Circumciſe the foreskin of your heart,</hi> Deut. 10.16. and God ſaith, Deut. 30.6. <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart.</hi> In the former verſe to the Text, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make themſelves new hearts and new ſpirits, which they could not do, therefore in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. the Lord promiſeth to give and put the ſame in them: <hi>Repent and turn your ſelves,</hi> Ezek. 14.6. and chap. 36.27.<note place="margin">Ideo dat praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ut exci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the verſe before our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us, that <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Adultery with her already in his heart.</hi> This was ſpoken in oppoſition to the <hi>Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and may be urged againſt many carnal <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that have but groſſe conceits concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and in particular, that the outward act of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe onely is the breach of the ſeventh Commandement; <hi>Thou ſhalt not commot adultery.</hi> Now our <hi>Saviour</hi> corrects this miſtake: That <hi>whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adultery
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46545:29"/> with her already in his heart;</hi> not will do it, but he <hi>hath done it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: there is a ſpeedy paſſage from the eye to the heart:</hi> And becauſe the eye and the hand are many times <hi>uſed,</hi> as principal incitements to this ſin, our <hi>Saviour</hi> gives his Diſciples and us this ſerious and holy advice in the words that I have read, <hi>If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out, and caſt it from thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The words contain <hi>a double Exhortation,</hi> together with <hi>a double Reaſon and enforcement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. A double Exhortation: <hi>if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and caſt it from thee: if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and caſt it from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A double Reaſon and Enforcement: <hi>For it is profitable for thee, that one of thy members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into hell:</hi> and ſo again, <hi>ver.</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>In the handling of theſe words, I ſhall firſt ſpeak to them by way of <hi>Explication,</hi> and then by way of <hi>Obſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Explication</hi> of them, I would entreat you to take into your thoughts theſe <hi>particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 We muſt enquire into the meaning of theſe two expreſſions, <hi>the right eye,</hi> and the <hi>right hand:</hi> moſt <hi>Expoſitors</hi> by far carry it, that theſe words are to be expounded <hi>improperly</hi> and <hi>figuratively:</hi> and here I ſhall not acquaint you, how <hi>Popiſts</hi> Writers abound in their own ſenſe, concerning theſe words: there are ſweet truths, that <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>freely,</hi> without ſtraining may be deduced from this Scripture; <hi>like the Bee, I would not tear the flower I light on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>two Interpretations</hi> given of this place, that I ſhall take notice of,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are ſome that by <hi>right eye,</hi> and <hi>right hand</hi> underſtand our neereſt, and deareſt comforts which we have in this world, which muſt be parted with for Chriſts ſake, yet not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration if they <hi>offend; If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out, and cast it from thee, if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and caſt it from thee:</hi> Now this is <hi>bona expoſitio,</hi> a good Expoſition, as our Divines diſtinguiſh, but not <hi>recta Expoſitio,</hi> a right Expoſition: agreeable to the analogy of faith, but not ſutable to the ſcope, and deſign of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in this place. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are others, that by <hi>right eye,</hi> and <hi>right hand</hi> underſtand beloved luſts, as hard to be parted with, as <hi>right hands,</hi> or <hi>right eyes:</hi> our Saviour mentions the <hi>right eye,</hi> and the <hi>right hand,</hi> becauſe they are moſt prized, as having more then ordinary of ſpirits and natural heat,
<pb facs="tcp:46545:29"/> and ſo more fit for action; I am ſure this may be ſaid concerning the <hi>right hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I conceive it an hard matter to prove, that by <hi>divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi> one hand ſhould be more uſeful then the other: but as God hath given us two eyes, and two ears, ſo two hands, to uſe both <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,</hi> and that if need required the one might ſupply the loſs of the other: if any, methinks the <hi>left hand</hi> ſhould be preferred, becauſe it is neereſt the <hi>heart,</hi> the fountain of life, and activity: but Chriſt takes them, as he finds them, as he doth in many other caſes, and as we have ordered the matter, the <hi>right hand</hi> is more active and ſtrong then the other, and ſo more precious: but to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Some, I ſay, by the <hi>right eye,</hi> and the <hi>right hand,</hi> underſtand our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved luſts; it is the uſage of the Spirit of God in the Scriptures, in a <hi>figurative way</hi> to expreſs corruption by the parts and members of our bodies: ſo St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.23. <hi>I ſee another law in my members,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> 
               <hi>warring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſin, which is in my members?</hi> and the ſame Apoſtle, Col. 3.5.<note place="margin">Col. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie therefore your members, which are upon the earth, fornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, inordinate affection,</hi> &amp;c. as the members of the natural body need <hi>caſtigation,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27.</note> 
               <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection,</hi> ſo the members of the ſinful body need <hi>mortification:</hi> and here in the Text ſin is expreſſed by the <hi>right eye</hi> and the <hi>right hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If thy right eye offend thee,</hi> in the Greek it is <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Pluck it out, and caſt it from thee; cut it off and caſt it from thee,</hi> a Metaphor taken from <hi>Chirurgions,</hi> whoſe manner it is, when the whole body is endangered by any part, to cut it off <hi>ne pars ſincera traha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> but before I leave theſe expreſſions, take notice of the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> that is in them, in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Tis not ſaid ſuffer thy <hi>right eye</hi> to be plucked out, or thy <hi>right hand</hi> to be cut off: but thou thy ſelf, <hi>pluck it out, and caſt it from thee, cut it off and caſt it from thee:</hi> to note two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we our ſelves muſt engage in the mortifying of our luſts: <hi>Sinners with their own hands, muſt pull out their own eyes.</hi> Tis not enough
<pb facs="tcp:46545:30"/> to cry unto God for help, and in the mean time, to be careleſs and idle, as if nothing were to be done on our part: <hi>mortification</hi> is a work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us, although we are impowred thereunto by the Spirit: <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8.13.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> we muſt mortifie, although by the Spirit; the duty is ours, though the ſtrength be Gods: ſo here, <hi>if thy right eye offend thee, thou thy ſelf pluck it out, and caſt it from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That we muſt be a willing people in this, as in all other duties: <hi>a Chriſtian dieth to ſin, is not put to death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Tis not ſaid if thine <hi>eye</hi> offend thee, obſerve it more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, look narrowly to it, but <hi>pluck it out.</hi> To note, that nothing leſs is like to do our ſouls good, then the mortifying, the killing, the cutting off of our corruptions. Let a mans <hi>hand</hi> be cut off it is a dead member immediately. It is not ſo with <hi>plants</hi> when they are cut off from their roots, they will grow and ſprout again: and ſo it is with the moſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour</hi> ſort of <hi>ſenſitive</hi> creatures, for inſtance, cut <hi>worms</hi> into ſeveral pieces, every part will live, and ſtir; hence the learned call them <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecta.</hi> When the head of a <hi>fowl</hi> is ſeparated from its body; it will live and flutter for ſome time: but this cannot be ſaid of the moſt noble ſort of creatures: this is a ſure rule in nature, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitas &amp; indiviſibilitas eſt comes perfectionis, multitudo, &amp; diviſibilitas imperfectionis.</hi> Union is a ſign of perfection, diviſibility of imperfection: the more perfect any being is, the more united it is to its ſelf, and the leſs any part of it can live <hi>niſi in toto,</hi> but in the whole! ſo that this phraſe is a great ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, to note the killing of our beloved luſts, <hi>if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and caſt it from thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tis not only ſaid <hi>pluck it out,</hi> but <hi>caſt it from thee,</hi> to note, that it is not enough for a man to leave his ſin for the preſent, but he muſt <hi>renounce</hi> it for ever. We muſt not part with ſin, as with a friend, with a purpoſe to ſee it again, and to have the ſame familiarly with it, as before, or poſſibly greater. <hi>Amantium irae amoris redinte gratio eſt,</hi> the falling out of Lovers is the renewing of love. We muſt not only ſhake hands <hi>with it,</hi> but ſhake our hands <hi>of it,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did ſhake the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per off his hand, into the fire! <hi>pluck it out and caſt it from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for the <hi>Explication</hi> of the words, for I ſhall have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only to deal, with the former part of theſe two Verſes at this time.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p>Oh be very watchful over this excellent part! <hi>make a covenant with your eyes,</hi> Job 31.1. <hi>Shut your eyes from ſeeing evil,</hi> Iſa. 33.15. <hi>Set no wicked thing before your eyes,</hi> Pſal. 101.3. as the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, <hi>Doth not even nature teach you:</hi> God hath made a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering for the <hi>eye,</hi> that opens and ſhuts with a great deal of eaſineſs, to teach us, that it is expedient ſometimes, that the <hi>eye</hi> be cloſed, and not holden open to every object.</p>

               <p>In the proſecution of this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> I ſhall follow, by Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance this method.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall enquire why ſin is expreſſed ſometimes in Scripture, by the parts, and members of our body, as in this place by the <hi>right eye,</hi> and the <hi>right hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew you, that our <hi>right eye</hi> ſins, and our <hi>right hand</hi> ſins, our beloved luſts, may in a more eſpecial manner be called <hi>ours;</hi> or that every man hath, his proper, his particular iniquity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall enquire how this comes to paſs, that particular perſons have their proper and particular ſins.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Uſe and Application.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I am to enquire, why ſin in Scripture is expreſſed by the parts and members of our body, and particularly here by the <hi>right eye,</hi> and the <hi>right hand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. You muſt note that the whole maſs of corruption in Scripture, is called by the name of the <hi>old man,</hi> and the <hi>body of ſin. Knowing this, that our old man is crucifi'd with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> It is called the <hi>old man!</hi> in every young man, there is an old man, and it is called the <hi>body of ſin:</hi> now if ſin in the lump and bulk be a <hi>body,</hi> then particular ſins may fitly be termed the <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>members</hi> of this body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sin may be thus expreſſed, becauſe as the natural body makes uſe of its ſeveral parts, for the managing and carrying on of thoſe works that are <hi>natural,</hi> ſo corruption makes uſe of ſeveral luſts, for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and promoting of thoſe works that are <hi>ſinful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. According to their notion, that hold the ſoul by creation, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſinne is conveyed into the ſoule at firſt by means of the body. Certainly the ſoule of man is pure, and undefiled, as it comes out of the hand of God. I do humbly propoſe to men of learning, whither
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46545:32"/> that rule, <hi>corporeum non agit in incorporeu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or that a body cannot defile a ſpirit, is not further to be taken into conſideration. We find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that as the ſoule communicates its affections unto the body, the body hath life, and ſenſe, and motion from the ſoule, that of it ſelf is a liveleſs lump of clay: So the body again hath a very great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the ſoul, and can, and doth communicate its diſtempers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. For <hi>inſtance,</hi> thoſe that have <hi>ſanguine</hi> bodies are enclined to luſt, thoſe that are <hi>cholerick,</hi> unto raſhneſſe and paſſion; thoſe that are <hi>melancholy,</hi> unto ſuſpition, &amp; tenaciouſneſs; thoſe that are <hi>phlegmatick,</hi> unto dulneſs and cowardize. So that ſin may be in the body <hi>diſpoſitivè</hi> before it be enlivened by the ſoule, though not <hi>formaliter;</hi> my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, the body may have a diſpoſition to defile the ſoul, before it is united unto the ſoul; and if ſo, no wonder if ſin be expreſſed by the parts and members of our body.</p>
               <p n="4">4, Corruption looks at, and ſhews it ſelfe by the ſinfull actions of the <hi>bodie,</hi> and therefore may have its denomination by the <hi>parts</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the Apoſtle, when he had concluded that the <hi>Jew,</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> were both under ſin; to make this manifeſt, he tells the <hi>Romans</hi> how ſin diſcovered it ſelfe in the outward man:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.13, &amp;c. 2 Cor. 7.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Their throat is an open ſepulchre, with their tongues have they uſed deceit, the poyſon of aſpes is under their lips, &amp;c.</hi> We read in Scripture of the ſins of the fleſh, as well as of the ſpirit. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit:</hi> the ſinnes of the ſpirit like ſo many plague-ſores break out into the fleſh. Wicked men are all over beſpotted, and beleopar'd with ſinne: Lying is a ſpot in the tongue, pride is a ſpot in the eye, wrath a ſpot on the brow, bribery a ſpot in the hand, Idolatry a ſpot on the knee, yea they are called <hi>ſpots and blemiſhes,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.13. not <hi>ſpotted</hi> but <hi>ſpots,</hi> ſin it ſelfe is a <hi>ſpot,</hi> and like fire, it turns the ſubject it hath to deale with, into its own nature. One part of the body in Scripture is called a <hi>world</hi> of iniquity. <hi>The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: How much iniquity is there in the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 3.6.</note> 
                  <hi>when in this little member there is a world of iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much ſhall ſuffice to have been ſpoken to the firſt thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>viz.</hi> why ſin is expreſſed ſometimes in Scripture, by the <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>members</hi> of our body.</p>
               <p>My ſecond worke is to ſhew you, that our <hi>right-eye</hi> ſins, and our <hi>right hand</hi> ſins, our beloved luſts may in a more eſpeciall manner, be called <hi>ours,</hi> or that every man hath his proper, his particular iniquity:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46545:32"/> 
                  <hi>If thy right eye offend thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thy right hand offend thee,</hi> &amp;c. Look as it is with good men, though they have the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of every grace in them, yet ſome one may be ſaid to be theirs in an eminent manner: <hi>Abraham</hi> was eminent for <hi>obedience, Moſes</hi> for <hi>meekneſſe, Job</hi> for <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> Thus it is with wicked men, though they have the <hi>ſeed</hi> of every ſin in them; yet ſome one may be ſaid to be theirs in an eſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Wicked men in Scripture are as it were <hi>marked</hi> out for ſeverall ſinnes, <hi>calculo nigro: Cain</hi> for his <hi>murder, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> for their <hi>treachery, Corah</hi> and his company for their <hi>conſpiracy, Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> for his <hi>pride, Manaſſes</hi> for his <hi>cruelty, Balaam</hi> for his <hi>covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> or look as it is in the naturall body, though every man hath blood, flegme, choler, melancholy, yet ſome humour or other is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, from which a man hath its denomination; ſo 'tis in the ſinful body, ſome ſinfull humour, or other hath the predominancy: moſt men have ſome <hi>peccatum in deliciis,</hi> ſome ſweet morſell, that they roll under their tongue, which they will by no means ſpit out, or part with. It would be no hard matter to ſhew you, that ſeverall Nations have their proper and peculiar ſins, as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> theirs, the <hi>French</hi> theirs, the <hi>Dutch</hi> theirs. Look into the Scripture and you will finde, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had their ſin, which is thought to be <hi>wantonneſſe,</hi> and <hi>uncleanneſs;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in the Epiſtles that he writes to them, uſes ſo many preſſing arguments againſt this ſin. The <hi>Creti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are branded for <hi>Lyars,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> for <hi>Idolaters:</hi> So your <hi>Towns</hi> have their ſins, <hi>Villages</hi> theirs, <hi>Cities</hi> theirs; poſſibly <hi>Londons</hi> ſin, may be loathing ſpiritual Manna, neglect and contempt of the Goſpel, a non-improvement of Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I am to enquire, how this comes to paſſe, that particular perſons have their proper and particular ſins.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Men have particular <hi>temperaments</hi> and <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of body, and therefore they have their particular ſins ſutable to their <hi>temperaments</hi> and <hi>conſtitutions:</hi> You heard before, how particular <hi>temperaments</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined men ſeverall wayes. Creatures in the generall are naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with thoſe things, which are fitted, ſuited and accommodated to the <hi>genius,</hi> and <hi>frame</hi> of their reſpective natures. As in the ſame plant, the <hi>Bee</hi> feedeth on the <hi>flower,</hi> the <hi>Bird</hi> on the <hi>ſeed,</hi> the <hi>Sheep</hi> on the <hi>blade,</hi> the <hi>Swine</hi> on the <hi>root:</hi> the ſame ſeeds are not proper for the <hi>ſand,</hi> and for the <hi>clay.</hi> Every thing thrives moſt where it likes beſt; ſo tis in this caſe, that ſin is like to thrive moſt in the ſoul, that we make moſt of, that we are moſt delighted in, that ſuits beſt our <hi>complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>conſtitutions.</hi> We muſt be carefull here, leſt we ſtrein this too
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46545:33"/> far, with ſome <hi>Phyſitians</hi> and <hi>Epicureans</hi> that hold the <hi>ſoule</hi> to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the <hi>temper</hi> of the body: but queſtionleſſe this hath a very great influence on the better part. Hence ſome have adjudged it not fit, for <hi>illegitimate</hi> perſons to be admitted into <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> orders: and you know under the Law, by the appointment of God himſelf, <hi>a bastard was not to enter into the congregation, to the tenth generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I humbly conceive, that a toleration of unclean mixtures is not onely againſt <hi>Religion,</hi> but againſt principles of <hi>polity</hi> and government: the children of filthy perſons, for the moſt part proving degenerate, ignoble, laſcivious, and by that means become the blemiſhes, the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, the plague-ſores of the body politique, Kingdom, and State where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they do belong.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are diſtinct and peculiar periods of times, <hi>diſtinct and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ages,</hi> that encline to <hi>peculiar ſins;</hi> for inſtance, <hi>childhood</hi> enclines to <hi>lenity</hi> and <hi>inconſtancy, youth</hi> to <hi>wantonneſs</hi> and <hi>prodigality, manhood</hi> to <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ſtatelineſs, old age</hi> to <hi>frowardneſſe:</hi> you know diſeaſes make men fretfull, now <hi>ipſa ſenectus morbus,</hi> old age it ſelfe is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: If we take not heed, the ſinfull body will grow ſtrong, when the naturall body grows weak. I have heard of a good woman, ſomething enclinable to paſſion, that uſed to ſay, I muſt ſtrive againſt peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe when I am young, or elſe what will become of me when I am old? And ſo <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> is a ſin, that <hi>old age</hi> is very much addicted to. <hi>Windelin</hi> in his Moral Phyloſophy, <hi>cap.</hi> 25. diſcourſes learnedly, <hi>Cur ſenes ſint magis avari quam juvenes?</hi> when God is taking people out of the world, they cling faſt about it, and cry <hi>loth to depart,</hi> truly this no good ſigne. You know men that are a ſinking, and in a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate caſe, lay hold on any thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Men have diſtinct and <hi>particular callings,</hi> that encline them to <hi>particular ſins:</hi> For inſtance, a <hi>Souldiers</hi> employment puts him upon <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi> and <hi>violence.</hi> And therefore <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> when the <hi>Souldiers</hi> demanded of him, <hi>what ſhall we do?</hi> tels them, <hi>Do violence to no man, neither accuſe any falſely,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. It may be known by the <hi>loves</hi> and <hi>tender reſpects</hi> the ſinner bears unto this <hi>ſinne:</hi> ſtrong love for the moſt part, hath but one ſingle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; affections are like the Sun beams in a burning glaſſe, the more united they are in one point, the more fervent: A wicked man hath a particular affection for his particular luſt. As <hi>Abraham</hi> cryed, <hi>Oh that Iſhmael may live in thy ſight!</hi> So, a wicked man, oh that this ſin may be ſpared! This is his <hi>Benjamin:</hi> the ſoul is ready to ſay, here is one ſin muſt be plucked out, and here is another ſin muſt be cut off, and muſt this beloved Luſt dye alſo? all theſe things are againſt me. The ſinner ſeems to repent of ſin, and to condemn ſinne, and himſelf for ſin: but when the time of Execution comes, the man is very tender-hearted; here's a reprieve for this ſinne, and there is a pardon for another ſin; oh it goes againſt him to cut the throat of his darling luſt! (<hi>'Tis a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſe when a man will undertake to pardon his owne ſinne:</hi> this is <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitas parcens, ſparing cruelty</hi>); and if it fall out, that his <hi>beloved</hi> ſinne dye a natural death, that is, if the Adulterer for inſtance, cannot actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally engage in bodily uncleanneſs, as formerly upon the account of old age, he follows it to the grave, as we do our dear friends, and heartily mourns that he and his <hi>dear</hi> luſt muſt part.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It may be known thus; that ſin that <hi>diſtracts</hi> us moſt in <hi>holy duties,</hi> is our beloved ſin: you may know that cold is natural to the water, and that it likes that <hi>quality</hi> beſt, becauſe let it be made never ſo hot, it will be ſtill working it ſelfe to its owne <hi>proper</hi> temper. Soules poſſibly may ſometimes be warmed at an Ordinance, but they quickly cool a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and are ſtill working towards their <hi>proper</hi> luſt, the ſin they like beſt. You may take notice in Scripture, that God to ſpeak after the manner of men in an eſpeciall manner, <hi>remembers</hi> the ſins of wicked men in the performance of holy duties.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 8.13.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſacrifice fleſh for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of mine offering, and eat it, but the Lord accepteth them not. Now

               <p n="2">2 The mortifying of our <hi>darling</hi> ſin is joyned with an univerſal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of <hi>all</hi> ſin: A true Convert <hi>hates every falſe way,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> phraſes it, ſin is often expreſſed in Script by <hi>abomination:</hi> it is ſo to God, it ſhould be ſo to man; anger is only with reference to <hi>particulars,</hi> but hatred is <gap reason="foreign">

I told you in the beginning of this diſcourſe, that the Text was part of Chriſts Sermon upon the Mount; and if you conſult the firſt and ſecond verſes of this Chapter, you ſhall find that it was preached to Chriſts own <hi>Diſciples, Vir bonus &amp; pius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> 
                  <hi>non eſt qui carnem non habet, ſed qui carnem ſuam mortificat:</hi> a good man is not one that hath no fleſh, but he that hath <hi>crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24.</p>
               <p>It is with our ſinfull body, as with our natural body: If you cut a Wenn or any Excreſcence of that nature, it will grow again, and again, and it will be an hard matter to be rid of it all your dayes: So though every day we be paring away our luſts, yet they grow again.</p>
               <p>To cloſe all, <hi>Go on and perſevere</hi> in the ſubduing and killing of thy <hi>beloved</hi> Luſt: Mortification is a worke once done, and yet in this life it is always a doing: There are ſome things that conſiſt of an <hi>iteration of multiplyed acts;</hi> as in Wedlock, perſons are actually married at once, the Husband ſurrenders himſelf unto the Wife, and the Wife ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her ſelf unto her Husband, and yet if they live together, ſutably to that neer relation; marriage is as it were renewed every day: there is a continuall ſurrender of themſelves each to other: So 'tis here, when the ſoul is firſt converted, the <hi>beloved</hi> ſin is mortified, and yet there is a continuall mortification of it: this is a duty that conſiſts not in any one act, though never ſo good, never ſo vigorous: but 'tis a continued act of the whole life. 'Tis not killing ſin at one blow; the ſtrength of ſin decays by degrees, it begins in the weakning of ſin, and ends in the deſtroying of ſin. <hi>Sin dies a lingring death,</hi> therefore let us go on in this great and neceſſary work. You know <hi>Sampſon</hi> deny'd, and deny'd <hi>Dalilah</hi> for ſome time, and would not diſcover where his ſtrength lay: but not holding out; he loſt his ſtrength and his life to boot: beware of Apoſtacy. <hi>Crabs that go backward are reckoned amongſt unclean creatures,</hi> Lev. 11.10. <hi>Factum non dicitur, quod non perſeverat</hi> is a max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, a Will not finiſhed, is no Will: a Deed, unleſſe it be ſigned, ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and delivered, is no Deed. The Sacrifice that was offered up unto God, was not to want ſo much as the tayle, <hi>Lev.</hi> 3.6.

            <p>But as <hi>Joſephs</hi> Interpretation once of the ſame nights dream, when rightly applyed, did rid the <hi>Butler,</hi> out of his miſapprehended fears, and onely left the <hi>more ſecure Baker</hi> under that execution which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apprehended, but himſelf never <hi>dreamt</hi> of, ſo neither this nor any other Scripture ſpeaks a word of terror to any <hi>ſin-troubled</hi> ſoul, that trembles at Gods threats.

            <p>Now there are three falls to which men are ſubject.</p>

            <p>This the fall of the godly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some fall as <hi>lead</hi> or <hi>ſtone</hi> into the bottom of hell, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hoſt into the bottom of the ſea, and never riſe again,<note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> having neither <hi>promiſe</hi> of God, nor <hi>ſeed of God</hi> to raiſe them up again,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.19.</note> but make a final ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warck of faith and conſcience, and of their ſouls together.</p>
            <p>This the fall of the wicked.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>mixt fall</hi> common to both, which is like the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into an Epidemical Diſeaſe whereof many dye, and as many recover, of which in their order.</p>
            <p>There are four kinds or degrees of falling, which the people of God are ſubject to; And four <hi>kinds</hi> or degrees to which the wicked are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and each latter is worſe then other in them both.</p>

               <hi>We cannot do what we would,</hi> but fail or fall ſhort after our beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. Our duties are imperfect, graces defective, our gold and ſilver droſſy, <hi>our wine mixt with water.</hi> Sin deceiveth, ſurprizeth, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveth, ſlayeth, yet reigneth not all this while. <hi>It is not I, but ſin that dwels in me.</hi> I conſent to the Law, <hi>I delight in the law of God, even in my inner man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe falls or ſlips are unavoydable &amp; involuntary, there is no Saint but complains of them, no duty but is ſtained with them. In our clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sun-ſhine we ſee a world of ſuch Moats which yet hinder not the light and comfort of our Juſtification, and deſtroy not Sanctification.

            <p>We are none of us <hi>Supralapſarians</hi> in this ſenſe, but <hi>Sub-lapſarians</hi> all, yea and <hi>Relapſarians</hi> too. <hi>The just falleth ſeven times a day, by this infirmity and riſeth again,</hi> and taketh no harm, but is kept hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and depending thereby.

            <p>This firſt fall is but like the fall of a <hi>miſt</hi> in a winter morning, the Sun gets up and it is a fair day after.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt fall: The ſecond is worſe, which is</p>
            <p n="2">2. An actual &amp; viſible ſtumble as to offence of others, yet occaſioned by ſome ſurreptitious ſurprize of temptation, for want of that due conſideration which we ſhould always have, this <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. the Apoſtle calls a mans being <hi>overtaken with a fault,</hi> who is <hi>to be reſtored with a ſpirit of meekneſs, conſidering we alſo may be tempted:</hi> ſuch falls (or ſlips rather) all or moſt are ſubject to <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi> We ſometimes trip, or ſlip, or <hi>miſſe our hold,</hi> ſo the word ſignifies, and ſo down we come, but not out of choice. Thus did <hi>Peter</hi> ſlip or <hi>halt, Gal.</hi> 2.14. when he did <hi>Judaiſe,</hi> out of too much complyance with the Jewes, whom therefore <hi>Paul</hi> did rebuke and <hi>reſtore.</hi> Thus the Diſciples ſlipt, when they in zeale to Chriſt would have fire fetcht down from heaven upon thoſe that would not receive them,<note place="margin">Luk. 9.54, 55.</note> whom Chriſt ſet right with a ſpirit of meekneſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſlips or falls are like thoſe of him whoſe foot is wrenched, or out of <hi>joynt,</hi> whence he halts till it be ſet right. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> is ſaid to halt;<note place="margin">Gal. 2.14.</note> he did not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: but when <hi>Paul</hi> had ſet his wrenched foot, he went upright ever after. Hence that word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>reſtore</hi>] is a Chirurgeons word, to ſet him right,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46545:43"/> as a bone out of joynt. He that ſhall be cenſorious and ſevere againſt theſe two firſt kind of falls incident to moſt, let him as <hi>Constantine</hi> ſaid to <hi>Aceſius</hi> the <hi>Novatian</hi> Biſhop, <hi>Get himſelfe a ladder,</hi>

               <hi>and climbe up to heaven by himſelfe,</hi> he ſhould have but a few come there elſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third fall is much worſe, a fall from the <hi>third loſt,</hi> whence like <hi>Eutichus</hi> they are taken up dead for the preſent, but they come to themſelves again. Theſe are falls into <hi>groſſer</hi> and more <hi>ſcandalous</hi> ſins which do <hi>Vaſtare conſcientiam,</hi> ſet the ſtacks or Corn-fields of Conſcience on fire, whereas the other two forenamed (eſpecially the former) are ſuch as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls <hi>Quotidianae Incurſionis,</hi> theſe are very dangerous, and befall not all Profeſſors (they had not need) but now and then one falls into ſome ſcandalous ſin, but they not uſually again into the ſame ſin after ſenſe and repentance of it. Thus fell <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> into foul flagitiouſneſs, but not <hi>deliberately,</hi> nor <hi>totally,</hi> nor <hi>finally,</hi> nor <hi>reiteratedly.</hi> Sin raged indeed, and ſeemed to reign for the preſent, <hi>Moſes</hi> hands grew weak, and the hand of <hi>Amaleck</hi> prevailed for the preſent: But a <hi>ſeed of God</hi> was in them,<note place="margin">1 John 3.9.</note> and they <hi>could not ſin unto death,</hi> but were renewed to repentance, and their ſins are blotted out.</p>
            <p>This fall is like the fall of the <hi>Leafe</hi> in <hi>Autumn;</hi> life remains ſafe; a Spring in due time follows, though many a cold blaſt firſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is yet one worſe fall than theſe former incident to a child of God too, to be of the decaying hand, and to remit and loſe his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fervour and livelineſſe.</p>
            <p>And it may be he never comes (as the ſecond Temple) up to the former pitch and glory.<note place="margin">Ezra 3.12; 1 King. 11, 4, 9, 10.</note> Thus <hi>Solomons</hi> zeale and love was abated in his old age, as his father <hi>Davids naturall</hi> heat was in his age, that he needed an <hi>Abiſhag</hi> to lye in his boſome,<note place="margin">Incepit melius qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus <hi>Sampſon,</hi> after many triumphs over the Philiſtims, was at length circumvented and betrayed into their hands, who bound him, put out his eyes, made ſport with him, who though his hair and ſtrength grew again, and he dyed in the Quarrell, and dyed a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, yet never did he regain his ſight or liberty to his dying day. Theſe kind of decays are dangerous, and make the people of God go mourning to their dying day, and they are ſaved as by fire. But are not inconſiſtent with grace.</p>
            <p>This is like the fall of the <hi>haire</hi> in aged perſons, life yet remains, but ſtrength, <hi>native</hi> heat, and <hi>radicall</hi> moyſtneſs decay, and the hair never grows alike thick again.</p>

The firſt whereof is a <hi>finall</hi> fall (but not a <hi>Totall</hi> at firſt) but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible</hi> by degrees, <hi>ſenſim ſine ſenſu,</hi> grow worſe and worſe, as the <hi>Thorny</hi> ground, choaked with cares, or drowned with the pleaſures of the world. This proves like <hi>Elies</hi> fall, they fall <hi>backward,</hi> break their <hi>necks,</hi> and dye of it, and may with him be much lamented and pittyed, but they are dead and loſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some fall <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>finally,</hi> but not <hi>premoditately</hi> and <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily</hi> at firſt, but are driven back by the lyon of Perſecution and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation in the way,<note place="margin">Mark. 4.17.</note> and they retreat. <hi>Theſe endure for a ſeaſon,</hi> as the ſtony ground; and leaving God, they are for ever left and forſaken of him. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9.</p>
            <p>This is like the fall of <hi>Siſera</hi> at the feet of <hi>Jael,</hi> Judg. 5.27. <hi>At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay downe: at her feet he bowed, he fell; where he bowed, he fell and lay down dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Some more fearfully, <hi>Totally, finally, voluntarily, deliberately,</hi> but not yet <hi>maliciouſly.</hi> Thus <hi>Demas</hi> is ſuppoſed to fall, who of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſciple or Teacher, is ſaid to have become after an Idol Prieſt at <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> (ſo <hi>Dorotheus</hi> reports of him.) Thus fell <hi>Saul,</hi> who having rejected the Word of the Lord,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.14.</note> the Lord rejected him, and <hi>the ſpirit of God departed from him, and an evill ſpirit from the Lord trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe three laſt I may ſay as <hi>Eliſha</hi> to <hi>Hazael</hi> of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> 2 King. 8.10. <hi>Theſe may certainly recover, howbeit, ſaith he; the Lord hath ſhewed me that he ſhall ſurely dye.</hi> Theſe have not yet crucified the Son of God afreſh, nor done deſpight to the Spirit of grace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not impoſſible they ſhould be renewed again to repentance.</p>
            <p>Theſe are like <hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3.1.2, 3. may have a name <hi>to live, but are dead:</hi> Their works not perfect before God, ready to dye, yet are called once again to Repentance, otherwiſe certain deſtruction threatned.</p>
            <p>But this is like the fall of <hi>Haman,</hi> whoſe doom was read by his wife and beſt friends.<note place="margin">Eſth. 6.13.</note> If once <hi>thou beginneſt to fall, thou ſhalt not recover, but ſhalt certainly fall irrecoverably.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe end fearfully uſually, and unpittyed ſpectacles of Gods wrath, to aſtoniſh and warn others as <hi>Spira</hi> once.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt fall follows, which is like the opening of the fourth Seal,<note place="margin">Rev. 6.8.</note> and the fourth horſe appears, <hi>a pale horſe, and he that ſate
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46545:44"/> on him is called Death, and Hell followed with him.</hi> When men fall <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, finally, voluntarily,</hi> and <hi>maliciouſly:</hi> Thus <hi>Simon Magus, Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, <hi>Hymaeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe names are in Gods black book. Here the Gulfe is <hi>fixed,</hi> and thee is a <hi>nulla retrorſum</hi> hence. Theſe are not to be renewed by repentance.</p>
            <p>This fall is like that of <hi>Jerichos</hi> walls,<note place="margin">Joſh. 6.20. Jer. 51.58.</note> they fell down flat with a <hi>curſe</hi> annexed, or as <hi>Babylons</hi> walls, with a <hi>Vengeance,</hi> both without hope of repairing. Or like the fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi> the firſt Apoſtate without offer, or hope of offer of grace any more for ever; or like the fall of <hi>Judas, who falling headlong burſt aſunder in the midſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>and all his bowels guſhed out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is alſo another kind of fall of a <hi>mixt</hi> or middle nature,<note place="margin">The mixt fall.</note> and to which ſide of the two, <hi>Godly or Reprobate,</hi> I ſhould caſt it is not ſo eaſie to determine. <hi>A reiterated fall</hi> into ſome foule act or curſe of ſinne, and herein I muſt proceed as warily as the Prieſt of old in a doubtfull caſe of <hi>Leproſie,</hi> whether to pronounce <hi>Clean or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 13, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.</note> and by his rule I ſhall go. He was to ſhut him up ſeven dayes, and look upon him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ere he could give his <hi>Definitive</hi> ſentence. If therefore</p>

               <note place="margin">Deut. 35.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning Relapſes, I ſhall deſire you to take notice of theſe eight obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is very obſervable that the holy Ghoſt is very ſparing in ſetting down in the Scriptures inſtances in this kind, well foreſeeing how apt <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> is to abuſe and pervert ſuch Examples to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: Such examples are as <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaid of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.34.</note> 
               <hi>ſet for the fall and riſing again of many, and are a ſigne ſpoken againſt.</hi> How have <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> falls emboldned many to fall and live in ſin. There is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46545:45"/> 
               <hi>not one inſtance</hi> in all Scripture of any Saint that laid violent hands up- himſelf, leſt any ſhould preſume to do the like. <hi>But one</hi> Example of late Repentance accepted, leſt many ſhould preſume, yet one leſt any ſhould deſpair. Thoſe falls are not ſet as <hi>Land-marks</hi> to guide you, but as <hi>Sea-marks</hi> to warn you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is certain <hi>Paul</hi> returned not to perſecute the Church after his Converſion, or <hi>Manaſſes</hi> to re-erect Idolatry, or <hi>Matthew</hi> to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Cuſtome after he was called thence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> fall again into the ſame ſoul act of ſinne after they had truly repented.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They were only wicked ones as <hi>Ahab, Pharaoh, Saul, Jeroboam,</hi> who perſiſt and return to ſinful courſes, <hi>from drunkenneſs to thirſt,</hi> from thirſt to drunkenneſs. Of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> it is ſaid; <hi>After this</hi> (the Prophets warning, his Arme ſmitten, his prayer thereupon, the recovery upon the Prophets prayer) <hi>Did he return again,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 13.33.</note> 
               <hi>and made of the loweſt of the people Prieſts of his high places, &amp;c.</hi> Neither warning, nor judgements, nor mercies could work any amendment in him.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">1 John. 3.9.</note>5. It is as certain that <hi>he who is born of God doth not commit ſin,</hi> ſo as to make a trade of it, returning to his Vomit: But <hi>he that is born of God keepeth himſelfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 5.19.</note> 
               <hi>and the wicked one toucheth him not.</hi> He hath paid too dear for ſuch a miſcarriage, it was not ſo light a matter to lye under Gods wrath, loſe his former peace, nor was his comfort ſo ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and Gods favour regained, that he ſhould hazard all anew, and buy Repentance at ſo dear a rate.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <note place="margin">Deut. 29.18, 19, 20.</note>6. Very dreadfull is that threat of God: <hi>If there be among you man or woman—or a root that beareth gall and wormwood: And it come to paſſe, when he heareth the words of this Curſe, that he bleſſe himſelfe in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walke in the imagination of my heart, adding drunkenneſs to thirſt. The Lord will not ſpare him, but the Anger of the Lord and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this Book ſhall lye upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under heaven. And the Lord ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate (and ſingle him out) unto evill,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>Obſ.</hi> Relapſes into ſin are like <hi>Relapſes</hi> into a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> after hopes and beginning of recovery, if by taking cold, or want of heed taking or other diſorder the diſeaſe return, and the man down again, this is worſe than the firſt ill fit, and long ere ſuch recover. But if as ſoon as he get a little ſtrength he fall into a new Relapſe, we reckon his caſe very doubtful, if not deſperate.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Yet it is not to be denyed, but there are ſome ſins of <hi>humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:46545:45"/> which though repented of, a godly perſon may be again <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken</hi> with and foyled, yet not his laſt end worſe then his beginning. Thus was <hi>Jonah</hi> overtaken with his paſſion a ſecond time, <hi>Abraham</hi> with his excuſatory lye,<note place="margin">Mat. 20.25. with Luk. 22.25.</note> the Diſciples after a former rebuke a ſecond time contending for ſuperiority.</p>
            <p>The firſt fall in this kind I ſhould liken to a ſad and dangerous <hi>fall,</hi> by which one hath broken a <hi>bone</hi> in his leg or arm, which though it put him to much pain is well ſet again, and he becomes as ſtrong as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but more wary while he lives, <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of his fall into ſin, that it was as a <hi>breaking of his bones.</hi> But a ſecond fall,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> is like the breaking of the bone the ſecond time, which is more hardly ſet, and put to more pain, and it may be the man feels it at times to his dying day.</p>
            <p>But a third or more frequent relapſe, is like the putting of an arm out of joynt, again and again, not being well bound and looked to in time, becomes habitually looſe and never keeps the place: ſo it is here, <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous</hi> and frequent acts of ſin beget an habit, and cuſtom in ſin, and then as ſoon <hi>may the Ethiopian change his skin, and the Leopard his ſpots,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 13.23.</note> 
               <hi>as one accuſtomed to do evil, ever learn to do well.</hi>

               <hi>Bernard</hi> deſcribes the ſteps of ſin, how it comes to its height. Firſt time it is <hi>importable,</hi> next time <hi>heavy,</hi>

            <p>Therefore if thou haſt been overtaken once, ſtop and be humbled, and ſay <hi>once I have ſpoken</hi> or done amiſs, <hi>but I will not anſwer</hi> to plead for my ſelf; <hi>ware</hi> the ſecond time, the ſecond fall, as the <hi>ſecond blow makes the fray:</hi> but if a ſecond time, ſay <hi>you twice, but I will proceed no further:</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> This 1. informs us that poſſible it is for men (yea too ordinary) to fall from grace: the Text ſuppoſeth it, and in another place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. the Apoſtle <hi>Items</hi> us to <hi>look diligently leſt any fall from the grace of God,</hi> the Angels did ſo at firſt, and <hi>Adam</hi> ſoon after, and that which was <hi>Morbus Angelicus</hi> then, is <hi>Morbus Anglicus</hi> now. The Lord may complain of us, as juſtly as ever he did of Iſrael, <hi>My people are bent to backeſliding from me,</hi> Hoſ. 11.7. and Eſay 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſmitten any more, ye will revolt more and more:</hi> and Jer. 8.5. <hi>Why is this people ſlidden back by perpetual backeſlidings? they hold faſt deceit, they refuſe to return.</hi> This is, and of late hath been the caſe and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Diſeaſe of <hi>England.</hi> It is no new thing to ſee the ſons of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man to fall, and fall away. <hi>Saul, Joaſh, Amaziah, Judas, Demas, Alexander</hi> fell away of old. Of all Iſrael that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> only two, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua followed God fully,</hi> Numb. 14.24. Of the four grounds in the Parable only one held out. Many of <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> hearers left him and fell away, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.35. Many of Chriſts hearers and diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.65. Many of <hi>Peters,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. Many of <hi>Pauls,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.15. Many of <hi>John</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts hearers, 1 Joh. 2.19. <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they they were not of us, for had they been of us, they would no doubt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with us: but they went out that they might be made manifeſt, that they were not all of us.</hi> But none of theſe were ever ſincere Chriſtians and ſound at the heart.</p>
            <p>We wonder not to ſee an houſe built on the ſand to fall, or ſeed not having root wither, or trees in the parched Wilderneſs decay, <hi>Jer</hi> 17.6. or Meteors vaniſh, or Blazing-ſtars fall, or Clouds without rain blown about, or Wells without ſprings dryed up. So for Hypocrites to prove Apoſtates no ſtrange thing, and utterly to fall away. There are four <hi>wills</hi> ſome have obſerved. 1. The <hi>Divine</hi> will never <hi>alters</hi> or <hi>turns.</hi> 2. The <hi>Angels</hi> will hath <hi>turned,</hi> never <hi>returns.</hi> 3.

               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:46545:46"/> after that grace received and abuſed <hi>turns</hi> away and never <hi>returns;</hi> but becomes like the fallen Angels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Even Godly and gracious perſons are ſubject to fall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt not be ſecure, they <hi>muſt work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2 12. they are bidden to <hi>fear leaſt they ſhould fall ſhort,</hi> Heb. 4.1. <hi>Stand faſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.13. <hi>Take heed leaſt they</hi> fall, 1 Cor. 10.12. <hi>Look diligently leaſt any fail of</hi> (or <hi>fall from,</hi> ſo is the other reading) <hi>the grace of God,</hi> Heb. 12.15. <hi>Take the whole armour of God that they may be able to ſtand,</hi> Eph. 6.12.</p>
            <p>Even the very Elect have this root of bitterneſs and ſeeds of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy within them. Even <hi>Peter</hi> had <hi>ſunk</hi> if Chriſt had not put forth his hand to ſave him from the water, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.31. and had been <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowed as chaff,</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Yet a truly regenerate ſoul, a plant of Gods planting by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſide; a plant or graffe grafted into Chriſt, and rooted in Chriſt can never fall away totally or finally: <hi>Peter</hi> could not when Chriſt pray'd for him.

Is this thy kindneſſe to thy beſt Friend, thy faithfull Counſellour, thy infallible Guide, thy Miniſter, and Oracle, thy ſweet and only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter?

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46545:64"/> now then <hi>omnis curatio fit per contraria,</hi> all cures are wrought by contraries, when therefore a faithful Meſſenger or Miniſter of Chriſt having made the ſick man ſenſible of his ſin, and afterwards of the pardon of it, and when he comes to diſcover to him his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, uprightneſs, holineſs, <hi>then God is gracious,</hi> &amp;c. although it is not at all impoſſible that here may be a reference to Chriſts righteouſneſs, for <hi>Job</hi> is no ſtranger to that, and the word ranſom carries an evident relation thither. So that both may be conjoyned.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>I have found a ranſom</hi> — I have received ſatisfaction, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the death of my Son, which was a ranſom ſatisfactory for the ſins of his people. And farther it is by vertue of this ranſom that Gods people are delivered, not only from hell, but from any other miſeries. Indeed as Divines diſtinguiſh of the reſurrection of the godly, and the wicked, ſo the temporal deliverances which wicked men receive they are the effects of common providence; but thoſe which Chriſts mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers receive, they have as the fruits of Chriſts purchaſe. And well ſaith God, <hi>I have found a ranſom:</hi> for it was beyond the wit of men or Angels to find out ſuch an admirable way for mans ſalvation: Thus you have had the coherence, diviſion, and ſenſe of the words.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral Doctrines which theſe words would afford, but I ſhall forbear the very mention of them, and only ſpeak of this one, which falls to my ſhare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That the ſeaſonable inſtruction of ſick and languiſhing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is awork as of great advantage, ſo of great skill and difficulty.</p>
            <p>I need not ſpend much time in the proof, yet ſomething muſt be ſaid of it: there are two branches,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is of great advantage. 2. It is of great difficulty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is a work of great advantage. It is convenient to ſay ſomething of this, becauſe I take it to be a common miſtake of many
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46545:65"/> perſons, they are apt to think; that ſick-bed applications are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner uſeleſs and ineffectual: it may be a diſcouragement which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil propoſeth to Miniſters or others to make them neglect this work, or be formal in it, eſpecially when the perſons are ignorant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane: the Devil may ſuggeſt the invalidity of a ſick-bed repentance, the cuſtomarineſs and hypocriſie of ſick-bed deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now to obviate ſuch ſuggeſtions, conſider theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the inſtruction of ſick perſons is Gods inſtitution, ſo you ſee in the Text —<hi>a meſſenger,</hi> i. e. one ſent of God, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: now Gods inſtitutions are not in vain: every inſtitution of God carries a promiſe in its bowels to him that doth not <hi>ponere obinem,</hi> that doth rightly uſe it: Miniſters or Chriſtian friends may go about it with much comfort, for it is Gods work, as he ſaid, <hi>Have not I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you,</hi> &amp;c. it is one of thoſe ways (as you ſee in the Chapter) which God ordained to reclaim ſinners: and when you attempt it, you may expect Gods concurrence. You may pray in faith for Gods aſſiſtance in his Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gods mercy is propoſed by himſelf, and may be offered by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, even to languiſhing perſons: it is true, it muſt be done cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly (as you ſhall hear) but it may be done, God doth indefinitely tender his mercy to all, and we muſt not limit where God limits not. Miniſters may ſafely follow Gods evample; and whereas it may be thought that ſuch men only come to God as driven by neceſſity, You muſt know that God is ſo gracious, that he receives even ſuch whom meer neceſſity drives to him, and indeed all true converts are firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to come to God by the ſenſe of their own neceſſities, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they are elevated to a more noble diſpoſition: God never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected any upon this ground: how many came to Chriſt meerly in ſenſe of their bodily maladies, and were ſent away with ſpiritual cure: Chriſt received her that came not to him, till ſhe had in vain tried all other Phyſitians. So in that parable of the Prodigal (wherein God is pleaſed to repreſent the methods of his grace in the converſion and ſalvation of ſinners) you ſhall find that God doth not reject that poor prodigal, becauſe he was forced home by that, <hi>Durum, telum neceſſitas,</hi> by inſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtraits and difficulties.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sick-bed repentance is not wholly impoſſible (though it be hard) ſickneſs is one means that God uſeth to work repentance, God can work repentance even upon a ſick bed, and it is God that muſt do it, even in health; and to ſpeak truly and ſtrictly, although the means of repentance be more probable, and the truth of repentance more diſcernable in health then in ſickneſs, yet the practiſe of repentance is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46545:65"/> as hard a work in health as in ſickneſs, ſeeing in both caſes it is the great work of the omnipotent God, who hath ever challenged it as his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prerogative to give repentance? whatever thoſe <hi>hoſtes gratiae Chriſti</hi> (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> cals them) ſay to the contrary, ſo that in ſhort, with men, repentance is always impoſſible, <hi>can the Ethiopian change his skin or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good that are accuſtomed to do evil,</hi> Jer. 13.23. but with God it is always poſſible. And yet to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the abuſe of this, by a preſumptuous putting off repentance to the time of ſickneſs, and death upon this pretence, I muſt add, that ſuch as put off repentance on ſuch a pretext do ſeldom meet with it. God doth ſeldom give repentance to ſuch perſons: and it is a general obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all ſerious Divines; that late repentance is ſeldom true, though true repentance is never late, it being the juſt judgement of God, that they that intend to mock God by putting off repentance ſhould deceive themſelves, and die without repentance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is a work of great difficulty might eaſily be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that will appear in the further proſecution of it all along, only there are two Arguments which the Text ſuggeſts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is a work which God hath put into the hands of his chief Officers, his Miniſters, who ought to be the moſt accompliſhed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is one of thoſe works for which God hath vouchſafed ſuch ſingular gifts unto his Meſſengers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is not every Miniſter neither who is fit for this work, and therefore here it is required, that he be one of a thouſand.</p>
            <p>But this I ſhall paſs over, and come to that which is allotted to me, the reſolution of this great and important caſe of Conſcience: <hi>How Miniſters or Chriſtian friends may and ought to apply themſelves to ſick perſons for their good, and the diſcharge of their own conſciences.</hi> I take it to be one of the hardeſt parts of the Miniſterial works to make ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable applications to ſuch perſons. I ſhall therefore endeavour to anſwer it, though not ſo fully as the point deſerves, yet ſo far as the brevity of this Exerciſe will permit, in theſe eight Propoſitions or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Endeavour muſt be uſed to underſtand the ſtate of the ſick perſon; As Phyſicians do by ſick perſons, they enquire into the manner of their life, diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is a great ſtep to the cure to know the Patients tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, becauſe as bodily ſo ſpiritual Phyſick muſt be ſuted to the temper; and diſpoſition, and condition of the Patient. And as Phyſicians take pains in this by conference with friends and by examining the Patient, ſo ſhould Miniſters by diſcourſe with religious acquaintance, and by ſearching conference with the ſick perſon, endeavour to find out the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46545:66"/> truth, for why ſhould not men be as accurate in healing mens ſouls, as their bodies? ſince the very Heathen could ſay, That all our care ſhould be tranſlated from the things of the body, to the ſoul, ſo <hi>Epictetus</hi> in his 6; Chapter, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. and as for the body men prize thoſe Phyſicians moſt that beſt know their temper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo ſhould ſick perſons prefer <hi>(caeterîs paribus)</hi> that faithful Miniſter that hath moſt knowledge of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The great buſineſs is to bring the ſick man to a true ſight of his ſtate and condition: indeed this is an happy thing, whatever his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be, if his conditio be ſound and good, then it is an happineſs to know it, that he may have the comfort of it, if it be bad, yet it is an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to know it, that a man may be capable of counſel, and put into the way to amend it: it is true, evil men, like perſons much in debt, care not to look into their books, and underſtand their debts, but they muſt be brought to it. And the worſe thy condition is the more art thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to diſcover it, for to be ignorant of thy condition, if it be good, only hinders thee from comfort, but if it be bad, it hinders thee from ſalvation: you and they muſt both conſider, that as the heart is always deceitful, ſo then eſpecially for three reaſons amongſt others. 1. Then men are impotent and unable to examine themſelves, their natural parts are weakned, the eyes of their mind clouded: their mind is diverted by bodily paines that it cannot attend, and ſo may ſooner be cheated. 2. Then men are ſloathful and liſtleſs as to all ſpiritual exerciſes: if even good men are ſloathful in their moſt healthful times, how much more evil men in times of ſickneſs? the liſtleſneſs of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy generally makes an anſwerable impreſſion upon the faculties of the ſoul, that being a received truth amongſt Phyſicians and Philoſophers, &amp; ratified by daily experience that <hi>mores animi, ſequuntur temperames <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">3. Miniſters and others muſt take great heed leſt while they avoid one extream, they run upon another, which is a common errour in practiſe, ſome for the prevention of deſpair, have made ſuch unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable applications of comfort, as have begotten preſumptuous hopes. Others again to prevent preſumption have ſo indiſcreetly aggravated things as to render them hopeleſs, and ſo careleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be a prudent contemperation of things together: as the wiſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician mixeth ſeveral ingredients, he puts in indeed things of a ſharpe and corroding nature, which may eat out or remove the noxious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46545:66"/> but addeth to them things of a more gentle temperature which by their leuity may correct the acrimony of the former: God himſelf ſets us a copy by the mouth of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.20 <hi>You have done all this wickedneſs,</hi> there is the corroſions, he faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers that, and doth not dawbe with them, yet, leſt the diſeaſe ſhould rather be exaſperated then removed, he addes this healing counſel, <hi>yet turn not a ſide from following the Lord,</hi> &amp; this Cordial v 22. <hi>The Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſame methods are not to be uſed to all ſick perſons: you might as well give the ſame pill to all diſeaſed perſons, whereas that which would cure one, will kill another; you may as well make one ſuit for all bodies: diſcreet Phyſicians diverſifie their applications, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the difference of the Patients diſpoſition and condition; ſo here, and there are many differences to be eyed here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Difference of tempers whether tender, or rough &amp; ſtubborn, as you read it is the husbandmans diſcretion that the fitches are not threſhed with a threſhing inſtrument, neither is the cart-wheel turned upon the cummine, but the fitches are beaten out with a ſtaff and the cummine with a rod, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.27. ſo it muſt be the diſcretion of a Miniſter, to have reſpect to the different tempers of men, in his applications to them: it is ſaid of Chriſt he taught the Diſciples as they were able to bear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Difference of education and converſation, ſome have been nuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled in ignorance, others brought up in the knowledge of the truth, not conſidering of this, occaſions much miſchief: Diſcourſe to an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perſon of the neceſſity of faith and repentance, you loſe your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour oft times, he conceits he hath believed and repented; for he takes faith to be a believing, though without any grounds, that God hath pardoned him, and repentance a crying God mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one muſt conſider where foundations muſt be laid—and where we need only raiſe ſuperſtructions: ſome have had a looſe and profane educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, others civil and religious: the former require more terrour, the latter more caution, leſt they deceive themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Difference of guilt. Great difference is to be made in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſinners of a ſmaller ſize, and inveterate ſinners: as God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, ſo Miniſters muſt endeavour that ſorrow may bear ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſin — <hi>Peter</hi> having ſinned grievouſly wept bitterly <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. laſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is a very bad guide to follow the counſels or deſires of ſick
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46545:67"/> perſons, or their carnal friends. It fares with faithfull Miniſters, as with honeſt and able Phyſicians, that are many times ill thought of by the ſick man and fooliſh friends, when they put him to pain, or trouble, they charge him with cruelty and delighting to torment the poor man unneceſſarily, &amp; it may be think of diſcharging him, and getting a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician that will deal more gently with him: whereas indeed he is the ſick mans beſt friend, and many times ſhould he not pain him, he would kill him: ſo is it here, Come to a ſick man, he cries, Comfort for Gods ſake, ſo ſay his friends, and they think all is done, if they can get com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: why you ſhall have it, but in due time, you ſhall have eaſe, health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but you muſt be contented to wait for it, and expect it in due order, firſt you muſt be ſick, oft times, that phyſick is the beſt, which makes you ſickeſt; you ſhall be healed; but, if you would proceed regularly and work a true cure, you muſt firſt have your wound ſearched, and then healed, elſe you have only a palleative cure, and the wound will feſter inwardly: and it is an horrible miſtake of ſick perſons they think comfort is all they are to look after, I tell you, it is not preſent comfort, but everlaſting happineſs, you muſt make your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to get: it is not <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to die quietly, like a Lamb (as the vulgar phraſe it) but a Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to die the death of the righteous: it is not ſo much a calm, and ſweet, and eaſie paſſage (the fiſhes have that, when they ſwim down the ſweet ſtream of <hi>Jordan,</hi> into the dead ſea, where they periſh) but a ſafe harbour one may go to heaven in a ſtorm, and to hell in a calm; and which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, judge you: thoſe wretches in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. have no bands in their death, and yet death hath dominion over them. Comfort is not the great buſineſs you need.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſame courſe for ſubſtance is to be taken for the converſion of ſick and healthful perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is but one way to heaven, for all perſons; and therefore conſider with your ſelves what you would do, if they were in health, and what were neceſſary then, why that ſame courſe you muſt take now: and if it be more troubleſome to ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they may thank themſelves for it; who neglected the time of their health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> indeed ſick men are apt to favour themſelves, and to think God will accept of leſs from them, then others, whereas, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, they have need to do more then others, and to make the more haſte, having the leſs time for their Work.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The greateſt care muſt be to keep ſick perſons from thoſe errours whereby ſuch perſons commonly miſcarry, ſuch as theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Inſenſibleneſs of their danger, whereas the firſt ſtep to a cure is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46545:67"/> to know ones malady. It is a dreadfull thing to ſee poor ignorant &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ſinners, at the very brink of the pit, ready to drop into hell, and not at all affected with it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If ever you mean to do them any good, you muſt awaken them out of that mortall ſleep or lethargy lighten their eyes with a conviction of their danger, leſt they ſleep the ſleep of death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Willingneſs to be deluded. You may know it thus: If a dawbing Miniſter, or friend offers comfort, how greedily they catch it: They will receive comfort upon any grounds, nay upon no grounds, but upon the bare words, it may be of a time-ſerving and man-pleaſing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. But let a ſerious and faithfull Miniſter come to them, and ſhew them their ſad, and ſinfull, and hazardous condition, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it by irrefragable arguments, they will not yield to it. But as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this they willingly are ignorant of. You muſt poſſeſs them with the folly of ſuch a temper, the unavoydable miſery of ſelf-deluding perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the dread of diſappointment when too late.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Careleſneſs and liſtneſneſs; This is the temper of many, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difficulty of believing, repenting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and remembring their own guilt, they caſt off the care of that, which they think will be to no purpoſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You muſt therefore poſſeſs them with the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Chriſtian carefulneſs; what madneſs it is to be careleſs now, which is the only ſeaſon of caring to any purpoſe; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What folly it is to free themſelves from the care of a few dayes, to aſcertain to themſelves everlaſting care and torment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo you muſt poſſeſſe them with the benefit of this care, and laying it to heart, &amp;c. That it is Gods courſe in opening the heart, to ſtir up this care.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Reſting in generals. <hi>Doloſus verſatur in generalibus.</hi> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives many into Hell: You may diſcourſe excellently againſt ſin in the generall, and raiſe in them ſome paſſion againſt it, yet not profit them at all, &amp;c. For true repentance takes notice of particular ſins, &amp;c. And as generals have no exiſtence, but in the particulars according to principles of Philoſophy: So it is ſin in particular, which doth prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily affect the heart of a true penitent.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The concealment of ſome hidden way of wickedneſſe, I believe, hath ſent many to Hell, they would never make their diſeaſe known, through fear of ſhame, &amp;c. As ſome perſons have died of thoſe diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which they have ſmother'd. It is true, a man is not bound to make confeſſion of all his ſins to a Miniſter, as we rightly aſſert againſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts: but yet all Divines grant, that in many caſes it is both expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46545:68"/> and neceſſary to acknowledge thy wickedneſs to men, and to ſay nothing of thoſe caſes wherein it is ſometimes neceſſary, nor of many reaſons which make it frequently expedient. I ſhall only inſtance in one, which is ſufficient of it ſelf many times; that the Phyſitian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more exactly thy malady, may more effectually proportion his remedy. Poſſeſs them with this in ſuch caſes, How infinitely better it is to have ſome ſhame before a friend, who will cover your ſhame, and hate to reproach you with it, then before all the world. Cconvince them, what folly it is to be unfaithful to themſelves, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Take heed of healing the ſouls of ſick perſons ſlightly, this we are very apt to. 1. From the ſick mans greedy deſire of comfort. 2. From the expectation and deſire of carnall friends. 3. From our own careleſſe hearts, that love not to put our ſelves to any trouble or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach (which we ſhall meet with, if we be faithfull in this caſe) however take heed of it. <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.11. <hi>They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people ſlightly, ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.</hi> This is the caſe: A ſoul (whether in ſickneſſe or in health) muſt firſt be wounded, then healed. There muſt be ſorrow and travel ere the Man child be brought forth. There muſt be true repentance and godly ſorrow— deep ſorrow (They dawb, that tell you other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and make God a lyar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>) Great heavineſſe of heart, &amp;c. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is neither a ſhort, nor a ſuperficiall work.—Perſwade them to wait Gods leaſure, and in Gods way for the cure, not to precipitate your work: Perſwade them not to be afraid of ſorrows, troubles, &amp;c. but rather to fear the want of it; for here is a common and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall miſtake, moſt men are afraid of ſorrow, and labour to drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſorrow: Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eas indeed ſorrow is the midwife of all true joy. Tears of penitential ſorrow, are the ſtreams that lead us to the Rivers of pleaſure, which are at Gods right hand: It is none other then the gate of heaven, the fountain of comfort: And on the contrary, to be a ſtranger to godly ſorrow, is one of the dreadfulleſt ſignes of a loſt ſoul. The laughter of ſuch a perſon, is a <hi>Riſus ſardonicus,</hi> a deadly joy. Labour more to work a ſolid, than a ſudden cure.</p>
            <p>There are other directions I thought to have given, but theſe may ſuffice, and I will conclude all with two or three Uſes, firſt to Miniſters, then to people.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To Miniſters. Hence we may learn the great difficulty of the Miniſteriall work, we ſee one reaſon why <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe things?</hi> O what a ſinne and ſhame is it to ſee what perſons venture upon this work? that ſuch undertake to be ſhepherds of Chriſts Flock, that are hardly ſit to be ſet with the dogs of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46545:68"/> flock? <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi> Many act, as if they thought this were all the worke of a Miniſter to make a few Sermons, read ſome Prayers, &amp;c. No, no, a Miniſter muſt be throughly furniſhed to every good worke, He muſt be apt and able for every worke: This, among others. O what Angelical abilities doth it require! Acuteneſſe to diſcern the ſick mans temper, knowledge to underſtand the nature of all Spirituall Diſeaſes, the Symptomes, the Prognoſticks, as alſo the Antidotes and Remedies. Wiſdome to make ſuitable, ſpeedy Applications. O how hard a caſe is it! Many ſick men can neither endure <hi>morbum,</hi> nor <hi>remedium,</hi> neither the diſeaſe of their ſoules, nor their remedy, &amp;c. A Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter had need know all things, underſtand all perſons, diſcern the ſubtilties of mens hearts, and not be ignorant of the wiles of the Devill.</p>
            <p>How many knots muſt he be able ſpeedily to untye? How many caſes muſt hee be able to give ſpeedy reſolution too? And hee muſt be ſuppoſed to have layd up with great induſtry, becauſe he muſt bring forth out of his Treaſure, <hi>things both new and old.</hi> O the difficulty! It is a ſad thing to conſider, that many ſouls do periſh not onely <hi>vi morbi,</hi> by the force of their Diſeaſe, but alſo <hi>errore medici,</hi> by the errour of their Phyſitian, by the miſtakes of their Miniſters: And as <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaks of phyſick for the body, it is alſo true of the phyſick of the Soul: <hi>In medicina nihil exiguum,</hi> In phyſick nothing is little, a ſmall errour there, may occaſion fearfull miſchiefs: So a ſmall miſtake in ſouls concernments, may occaſion a ſouls everlaſting ruine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To people: Is it of ſuch difficulty? O labour you to do your work in health, while time and ſtrength laſt, before the evill dayes come, &amp;c. It is a ſerious Admonition of <hi>Gregories</hi> in his Book <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cura paſtorali ſalus corporis quando ad bene operandum accepta de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicitur quanti ſit muneris amiſſa ſentitur:</hi> He that neglects the time of health for the doing of his great work, he ſhall feel the worth of it by the want of it. I beſeech you let me reaſon with you: Why will you run an hazard, when you may go a ſafe way? Conſider what woful ſtraits you will bring your ſelves too, if you do not ponder your ways, and fix your thoughts, and afflict your hearts, You kill your ſouls; if you do, perhaps your bodies, &amp;c. what a dreadfull <hi>Dilemma</hi> is this, &amp;c. The Phyſitian chargeth you not to trouble your ſelves with ſad thoughts, leſt you overthrow your bodies: and the Miniſter, If he will be faithful, muſt charge you to trouble your ſelves,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46545:69"/> leſt you loſe your ſouls. O conſider now; now you may conſider, you have the uſe of reaſon, then reaſon maybe loſt, &amp;c. Now God will accept of you, then it may be he will reject you, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. Now yau are at leaſure to conſider, then <hi>ſufficient unto the day will be the evil thereof.</hi> And therefore be perſwaded to improve the time of health. It is the general cuſtom of ſick perſons to ſend for Miniſters to prepare them for the future life, when they deſpair of the enjoyment of this preſent life. A learned man wittily obſerved, that as they ſay, <hi>ubi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinit Philoſophus, incipit Medicus:</hi> So it may be ſaid, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi deſinit Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, incipit Theologus,</hi> where the Phyſitian ends, the Divine begins. Thus they begin to live at the end of their life: But you, if you be wiſe take this counſell (and ô that my words might prevail with you) deſire to ſpeak with able &amp; godly Miniſters in the time of your health: That, that is the acceptable time; Then may they give counſell freely, and you may follow their counſell throughly. That was the courſe of thoſe Converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. They did not tarry till their ſouls were ready to breath out themſelves into eternity, but in the time of their health applyed themſelves to <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Make ſuch applications to your friends in health, as you muſt do in ſickneſs (if you mean to diſcharge your duty to God, or friendſhip to them) you will give them and your ſelves too great eaſe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by it, &amp;c. Remember what obligeth you to do it in ſickneſs, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth you alſo in health; you are your Brothers keepers, you have all, <hi>curam animaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> cure of ſouls. And as Miniſters are bound to this work <hi>virtute officii,</hi> by vertue of their office, ſo you are bound to it, <hi>ex lege charitatis:</hi> And ſurely if every one of you, are bound to deliver your neighbours Oxe or Aſs, when you ſee it falling into a pit, much more are you obliged to have compaſſion upon their ſouls, when they are going down to the pit, from which there is no redemption.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How a man may be ſaid to partake of other mens ſins:</hi> To this I anſwer, There are <hi>many wayes</hi> whereby we contract the guilt of others ſins: <hi>Lord,</hi> ſayes David, <hi>who knowes how oft he offends?</hi> I will name ſome of them.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>eight wayes</hi> eſpecially noted in Scripture, by all which a man is made <hi>partaker,</hi> and becomes <hi>guilty</hi> of the ſins of others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By contrivance,</hi> by plotting and contriving of ſin, by provoking and ſoliciting others to ſin; and this is in an high degree to be guilty of other mens ſins. Thus <hi>Jonadab</hi> was guilty of <hi>Amnons</hi> Inceſt by his ſubtill <hi>contriving</hi> of that wickedneſs, by being a Pander to that Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p>When a man ſhall wittingly and willingly ſpread a ſnare in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers way, and either <hi>drive</hi> him in by <hi>provocation,</hi> or <hi>decoy</hi> him in by <hi>allurement,</hi> hee makes himſelfe a partaker of his ſin. <hi>E g.</hi> to provoke a man to Paſſion, to tempt a perſon to Drunkenneſſe and uncleanneſs, to put a man upon Murder and blood-ſhed, to draw ſouls into Errour, Hereſie, Blaſphemy, &amp;c. this is to eſpouſe and adopt the ſin, and to make it a mans own.</p>
               <p>You know the Story there, 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 11. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> was ſlaine with the edge of the ſword, <hi>David</hi> was many miles off when <hi>Uriah</hi> was ſlain, he died in the battel, <hi>Joab</hi> put him in the front, and the <hi>Ammonites</hi> ſlew him: but now becauſe <hi>David</hi> plotted and <hi>contrived</hi> all this, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tells us that <hi>David</hi> was the Murderer. 2 Sam. 12.9. <hi>Thou haſt killed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah the Hittite with the ſword, thou haſt ſlain him with the ſword of the children of Ammon.</hi> Though the <hi>blade</hi> was the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and the <hi>hilt</hi> might be ſaid to be <hi>Joabs:</hi> yet the <hi>hand</hi> was <hi>Davids,</hi> and the <hi>deed</hi> was <hi>Davids.</hi> The Ammonites <hi>ſlew him,</hi> but David <hi>murdered him.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, he was <hi>a blaſphemer and a perſecutor, and injurious,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. Why Beloved, we doe not read of any blaſphemy that S. <hi>Paul</hi> uttered in all the Bible: Oh but, ſayes he, <hi>I compelled the Saints to blaſpheme,</hi> Act. 26.11. There was his blaſphemy in compelling others to blaſpheme.</p>
               <p>Beloved, to incite and provoke any to <hi>ſinfull practices,</hi> to ſeduce and ſolicite any to <hi>looſe doctrines and erronious opinions,</hi> it is to be doubly

               </p>
               <p>Hence is that frequent expreſſion among the Fathers concerning <hi>Arrius</hi> the Heretick, that look how many ſouls he had ſeduced to his hereſie and blaſphemy, ſo many ſeverall additions of torments he had in hell, as guilty of all their ſins: Oh man, whoever thou art that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thy neighbour drunk, by <hi>putting the bottle to his mouth,</hi> that calleſt to thy brother, ſaying, <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider, <hi>you have ſins enough of your own,</hi> you have no reaſon to partake of other mens; it is cruel to <hi>add affliction to your bonds. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had no ſins of his own, and therefore hee could and did bear ours; hee did <hi>take</hi> all mens ſins, though hee did not <hi>partake</hi> of any mans ſins, all were his by <hi>imputation, Iſa.</hi> 53.6. <hi>Hee hath laid upon him the inquities of us all,</hi> but none were his by <hi>perpetration</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation.</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:46545:77"/> It is not ſo with us, alas! wee have ſins enough of our own; Man, Woman, thine own <hi>pride</hi> will damn thee, if thou doſt not repent; and thine own <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> and <hi>formality,</hi> and <hi>worldlineſs,</hi> and <hi>hardneſs</hi> of heart; thou haſt no need to take the ſins of others, ſaid the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> our <hi>Father died in his own ſin,</hi> Numb. 27, 3. aye, that is enough to <hi>kill</hi> a man, and <hi>damn</hi> a man, <hi>his own ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, <hi>It is a most monſtrous ſin, it is a moſt dreadful ſin to partake of other mens ſins.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>committing iniquity with greedineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4.19. Sirs, there is no ſuch greedy ſinning as this, for a man to lick up, and ſwallow down, and devour other mens ſins. <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> tells us, that <hi>Serpens Serpentem devorans ſit Draco,</hi> If a Serpent ſwallow down another Serpent it becomes a Dragon. Oh <hi>Chriſtians!</hi> this ſin of devouring other mens ſins, it is a <hi>Dragon-ſin,</hi> a <hi>Monſtrous-ſin,</hi> a <hi>Dreadful-ſin,</hi> a <hi>Deviliſh-ſin,</hi> and therefore take heed of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider, <hi>If you partake of other mens ſins, you ſhall certainly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of other mens plagues,</hi> Rev. 18.4. <hi>Come out of her my people,</hi> ſaies God, namely, from <hi>Babylon, that you be not partakers of her ſins, that ſo yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not of her plagues.</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. <hi>A companion of fools ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed</hi> not only <hi>fools</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, but a <hi>companion</hi> of fools ſhall be deſtroyed: if you <hi>ſin</hi> with them, you ſhall <hi>ſuffer</hi> with them, and you ſhall <hi>ſuffer more</hi> becauſe of them. Read that, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.27, 28. <hi>And the rich man ſaid, I pray thee Father Abraham, that thou wouldeſt ſend Lazarus to my Fathers houſe, for I have five Brethren, that hee may te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie unto them, leſt they alſo come into this place of torment.</hi> Why would not hee have his Brethren to come to Hell to him? Divines determine, not out of any <hi>love to their ſouls,</hi> there is not that charity to bee ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Hell. Oh but becauſe the ſight of them, <hi>and company of them would increaſe his torment.</hi> This will bee the ſchreeking and howling in Hell among damned ſouls one to another; oh woe worth <hi>the</hi> day that ever I ſaw <hi>thy</hi> face, or that ever I ſaw <hi>thy</hi> face, thou haſt brought <hi>mee</hi> hither, and thou haſt brought <hi>mee</hi> hither; and ſo they will torment one another to all eternity.</p>

                  <p>Among National ſins, <hi>eſpecially</hi> take heed of <hi>Prophaneneſs;</hi> this is obvious, this is an univerſal ſpreading plague, that is like to infect the whole Kingdome, if God does not in mercy prevent it. There is a deluge of prophaneneſs breaking in on every ſide, Swearing, Drinking, Whoring, Sabbath-breaking, Scoffing, and Mocking at Religion, all the Countries ring again. Men are now grown bold, and audacious, and incorrigible in their wickedneſs, that like a <hi>Titan-brood</hi> they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven threaten Heaven it ſelf with an over-daring impudence, as if they would ſtorm the Palace of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and pluck him out of his Throne. Oh take heed of partaking here!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Family-ſins,</hi> wee muſt have a care of partaking here, and ſo much the more watchful muſt wee bee, in that Family-ſins of all ſins are moſt catching and infectious; As it is with bodily diſeaſes, if one bee ſick in an houſe, they of the blood, and kin, and family, are likeſt to catch the diſtemper, becauſe of their frequent and intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe eſpecially: So it is here, if there bee any predominant luſt lurking in a family, all are apt to bee infected with it, if they are not marvelous circumſpect and watchful.</p>
                  <p>And therefore Parents, and Maſters, and Governours of Families had need to bee reformers both of themſelves, and all under their charge; for beſides, that this is the moſt compendious and ſafeſt way to State-Reformation, and Church-Reformation. Every Family being a kinde of a little Kingdome of it ſelf, and a little Church of it ſelf, wherein the Maſter is both King, Prieſt, and Prophet; beſides this, there is the ſound of this Argument, and reaſon to allarum them <hi>(viz.)</hi> as they deſire to have their ſouls and conſciences free from the guilt of other mens ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> ſeeing a childe do miſchief in the ſtreets, went forthwith and corrected his Father for it; that Father that does not correct his childe when hee does amiſs, is juſtly corrected for his faults, and it is the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Gods judicial proceedings, as hee viſits the iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children, who <hi>imitate them:</hi> So hee viſits the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of the Children upon the Fathers, who <hi>countenance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge them.</hi> As <hi>Jacob</hi> was countable to <hi>Laban</hi> for the whole flock, not a Sheep or a Lamb loſt or torn, but it was required at his hands, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.39. Thus muſt Family Governours bee accountable to God for every Lamb in the fold, for every childe in the family, for every ſervant in the houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.2.

                  <p>Ah how many Families are there whoſe houſes are not the <hi>Church of God,</hi> but the <hi>Synagogue of Satan</hi> rather; God is not in all their thoughts, nor God is not in all their mouths, except it bee in ſwearing and curſing, and blaſpheming.

                  <p>And therefore Chriſtians for the Lords ſake, <hi>out</hi> with all this rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh, if it ſhould bee found in your families; How do you in <hi>London</hi> here delight to have your houſes clean, and hereupon ſweep them, and waſh them, and rub them; oh that you would bee as careful to cleanſe your <hi>Families</hi> from <hi>ſin,</hi> as you are to cleanſe your <hi>houſes</hi> from <hi>dirt;</hi> how ſoon would this great City become <hi>an Habitation of Righteouſneſs, and a Mountain of Holineſs;</hi> how would this Family-Reformation prevent the guilt of Family-ſins, and keep out Family-diſtractions, and ſecure from Family-deſolation.

David</hi> mourned for the wickedneſs of the times that hee ſaw, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.136. Many walk, ſaies <hi>Paul,</hi> of whom I tell you weeping. Thus did Gods people of old free themſelves from National ſins, and particular mens ſins. When they could not bee reformers they turned mourners, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.17. And ſee how prevalent this is with God, theſe mourners are the onely people to deliver a Nation, or at leaſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themſelves from the ſin and plagues of a Nation, when God makes an overflowing ſcourge to paſs through, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, not mourning for the ſins of others, makes us adopt, and eſpouſe the ſins of others. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antid.</hi> 5. <hi>Reprove them,</hi> Ezek. 3.17, 18, 19. If wee would not partake of the ſins of others, wee muſt reprove the ſins of others, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.7, 8, 9. So the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that you do certainly approve them, if you do not reprove them. Reprove Hereſie, Blaſphemy, Drunkenneſs, Oaths, Sabbath-breaking, Uncleanneſs, and every ſin you hear or ſee committed.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46545:79"/> The Raviſht Virgin under the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.25. was to cry out; in this caſe God takes ſilence for conſent. As there is a holy ſilence to Gods Correction, <hi>Aaron</hi> held his peace; ſo there is a ſinful ſilence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mans corruption, <hi>Eli</hi> held his peace alſo; <hi>Aarons</hi> ſilence was a good ſilence, but <hi>Ely's</hi> ſilence was a naughty ſilence; wee muſt bee ſilent under Gods correction, but wee muſt not bee ſilent under mans corruption, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.1. Therefore ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Reprove them; the beſt way to avoid fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, and to free a mans ſoul from the guilt of other mens ſins, is to reprove them, that is the Antidote againſt this infection. Thus the <hi>Epheſians</hi> practiſed as St. <hi>Paul</hi> preacht. St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not more adviſe them to this duty, than St. <hi>John</hi> does commend them for this duty. Saies the Holy Ghoſt there in <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. compared together — haſt born, and yet haſt not born — Gods Correction — mans corruption. I know thy patience, and how thou canſt not — it is no breach, of patience to bee impatient againſt ſin, and ſinners. But now beloved, becauſe this ſword of Reproof is a very dangerous weapon, if it bee not rightly handled, an edge-tool that wee muſt bee marvelouſly chary how we meddle with; There is required therefore a great deal of skill, and prudence, and wiſdome, and watchfulneſs, to a right and ſucceſsful managing of this duty, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.11. Hee that would faſten this nail of Reproof, in the conſcience of his offending Brother, had need bee a very wiſe man. Yea, as I remember, <hi>I ſiod. Pelus.</hi>

                     </gap>. Every one can finde fault, and reprove another for the ſame, but to do it diſcreetly and ſeaſonably, and ſucceſsfully requires a great deal of wiſdome; and to this end I ſhall give you theſe Rules. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof is double.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Miniſterial, and by way of Authority, and Fraternal, by way of Charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And here wee come to the ſecond caſe,</hi> viz. <hi>Reproof.</hi> 1. <hi>Hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves another, muſt bee very careful that himſelf bee faultleſs and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as much as may bee;</hi> otherwiſe hee is not acting his Charity, but bewraying his Hypocriſie. Thou that teacheſt another — <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.21, 22. This is Hypocriſie, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.3, 4, 5. — And here there are two things coucht in this;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A man muſt bee faultleſs in reference to ſin general, as much as may bee, that will reprove another.</hi> The ſnuffers of the Sanctuary under the Law were of pure gold, and it behoves that man, that will bee a ſnuffer in Gods houſe, to correct others, to amend others, and reprove others; to bee very upright and circumſpect in all things, and then he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46545:79"/> may admoniſh with the greater Advantage, Authority, Efficacy. Let the <hi>Righteous</hi> ſmite mee, ſaith <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 141.5. A man of a ſtrict and ſevere life, and religious and righteous converſation, carries a kinde of a Majeſty and Authority along with him, at which the guilty conſciences of guilty ſinners cannon but recoil, as <hi>Herod</hi> did to <hi>John Baptiſt, Mark 6.20.</hi> — Though <hi>John</hi> had reproved him, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the quick, <hi>v.</hi> 18. And then</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A man muſt bee blameleſs in reference to that ſin hee reproves eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially;</hi> elſe, in healing his Brother, hee doth but ſtab himſelf; if thou reproveſt Pride in others, and art proud thy ſelf; <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> and art covetous thy ſelf; <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> and art a drunkard thy ſelf, thou doſt but like <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Nathans</hi> Parable, pronounce the ſentence of thine own condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1. But here I muſt enter one Caution, none is exempted from this duty for unfitneſs; no, this thou oughteſt to have done, and not to have left the other undone.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.— <hi>As hee must take heed that himſelf bee faultleſs, ſo hee must be ſure that his Brother bee faulty;</hi> For otherwiſe it is not to reprove him, but to reproach him; and ſo inſtead of doing a Chriſtian duty, a man commits a deviliſh ſin; hee becomes an accuſer of the Brethren in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Reprover of the Brethren, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. And here are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe two things conſiderable;
<list>
                        <item>1. It muſt bee a truth that thou reproveſt him for.</item>
                        <item>2. It muſt bee a ſin that thou reproveſt him for.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It muſt not be a conjecture, or imagination, or jealouſie, or rumour, or hear-ſay that's ground ſufficient for Reproof: for all theſe may be falſe, and the Rule of Charity is, <hi>quiſquc praeſumitur eſſe bonus niſi conſtat de malo</hi> — but verily the guiſe of the world is far otherwiſe; wee deal with our Brethren as the perſecuting Pagans did with the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians put them into Lions skin, and into Bear skins and then bait them, and tear them to peeces. Alas! the poor Chriſtians were harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, meek Lambs, but they diſguiſed them, and ſo abuſed them. Thus 'tis now, Chriſtians are apt and ready to put their poor Brethren into I know not what kinde of monſtrous, ugly ſhapes, of their own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, and deviſing, or elſe of other mens traducing and reporting, and without more ado, they fall ſoul upon them; This is not to imitate our Saviour, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 11.2, 3, 4. — Not from rumours — but with righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and equity, as God ſaid in deſtroying of <hi>Sodome,</hi> ſo ſhould we ſay in reproving our Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.21. <hi>I will go down and ſee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It muſt bee a breach of ſome command Affirmative or Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, directly or reductively; either the omiſſion of that which is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46545:80"/> good, or the commiſſion of that which is evil; — wee muſt bee <hi>Cato</hi>'s, —not <hi>Momus's.</hi>—As the Phariſees, ſo Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.3. So here, is it lawful to reprove a man for every cauſe? no, the Diſciples were quite out in reproving the children for coming to Chriſt in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. when it was not their ſin, but their duty, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14. Quakers make a ſtir about Cuffs, and Bands, and Ribbons, and Laces, and ſuch like minute trifles of Phariſaical Humility, if they can prove theſe ſins, let them reprove them in Gods Name; but if they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, it is cenſoriouſneſs, uncharitableneſs, and pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalneſs to rail at them, and not Chriſtian Reproof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.— <hi>Hee muſt manage his Reproof to ſincere ends;</hi> muſt take heed that his aims and intentions bee upright and honeſt in reproving. Take heed of mingling any wilde-fire of pride, and vain-glory, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humour of contradicting and controuling others, with thy zeal of Reproving; This heat muſt bee holy heat, a fire of the Sanctuary as free from the ſmoak of by-ends, and ſelf-intereſt, as may bee, purely for Gods glory and out of hatred unto ſin, and out of love to the ſalvation of thy Brothers ſoul. <hi>Diogenes</hi> (it is ſtoried) reproved <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s pride, by trampling upon his Velvet Chair and Cuſhion, but ſaies, the Author, <hi>Majori faſtu ſuperbum Platonem Diogenes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hee muſt manage his Reproof in fit ſeaſon;</hi> There is a time to ſpeak, and a time to bee ſilent; Reproof is a duty grounded upon an Affirmative Precept.

There are certain <hi>mollia Tempora fandi,</hi> words upon the wheels, as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls them, that are like Apples of Gold; and let mee tell you Chriſtians, one word ſpoken in ſeaſon, is worth a thouſand other words. Now it is impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine and determine all the nicks of time wherein a man ſhould ſtrike in with a Reproof; for this muſt bee left to the wiſdome and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of every Chriſtian, that makes it his buſineſs to bee his Brothers keeper; and let him aſſure himſelf, hee muſt expect to loſe many an admonition, ſhoot many an Arrow, of Reproof, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did his, under and over, on this ſide and tother ſide, before hee hit the mark.</p>

Oh but if a man be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Monitour, hee muſt bee impartial in his reproofs. <hi>Agag</hi> muſt be reproved as well as the pooreſt <hi>Amalekite,</hi> and the Mountains muſt be toucht, let them ſmoke and fume never ſo furiouſly, to allude to that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.5.

For theſe it is, that our Apoſtle groans; for theſe hee is ſo ardent in prayer; for theſe hee pours out ſuch earneſt petitions to the Father.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The great ſcope and deſign of the Apoſtle for his kindred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations according to the fleſh in all his deſires, endeavours, prayers was [<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>From all theſe parts laid down together, there reſult this Doctrinal Concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That to endeavour the converſion and ſalvation of our near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations is a moſt important duty.</p>
            <p>The preſident and example of our holy Apoſtle compared with, and confirmed by other Scriptures, will notably evince the truth of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.7.</note> 
               <hi>The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall.</hi> One great end, why God beſtows the graces of his Spirit upon us, is, that wee ſhould ſpend the ſavour thereof upon others.

When converted, wee are injoyned to ſtrengthen our Brethren, that wee may ſave their ſouls from death,<note place="margin">James 5.20.</note> and hide a multitude of ſins.</p>
            <p>Now the principal Objects of this excellent duty are ſuch with whom wee converſe; ſuch to whom wee are obliged and connexed by the bonds and links of nature, office, or vicinity of habitation.</p>
            <p>Hence was it that our bleſſed Lord, while hee walked in the valley of his Incarnation, exerciſed his Miniſtry moſt part among his kindred, relations, and neighbours; at <hi>Nazareth, Capernaum, Bethſaida,</hi> neer the Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> at <hi>Cana,</hi> and other Regions of <hi>Galilee,</hi> in which parts hee had receive his Education <hi>Andrew</hi> when hee underſtood the call of Chriſt the gret Saviour of the world;<note place="margin">John 1.41.</note> hee preſently ſeeks

            <p>O Brethren, if families were holy, then Cities, then Nations would quickly prove Mountains of Holineſs, and Seats for the Throne of God. Wee are apt to cry out of bad times; Alas, thoſe unclean Neſts of ungodly Families have been the cauſes of all the wickedneſs in all Ages and Generations to this day. Therefore whoever thou art, on whom the Grace of God hath ſhined, ſtudy that holy art of Divine Reflection, and Re-percuſſion of that light on others hearts, which bring's mee to an uſeful and practical queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> You I ſay, <hi>What courſe ſhall wee take, what means ſhall wee uſe, what method will you preſcribe, that wee may bee able to manage this important and weighty duty; that wee may bee helpful towards the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſalvation of our neer Relations that are in the ſtate of nature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs this Queſtion is of grand importance, and being properly ſolved, may prove of great influence in all places where wee are caſt by Divine Providence. There is ſcarce a family, ſcarce a perſon living, who may not bee comprehended within the verge and limits of this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> In anſwer therefore to it, I ſhall ſpend the principal part of my time, and that I may handle it the more diſtinctly; I ſhall rank ſuch as may deſire ſatisfaction and direction in this weighty and excellent caſe under three forms or orders: Such as are either Superiours, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, or Inferiors. But before I enter into the main body of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I ſhall crave leave to premiſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this Queſtion is not to bee underſtood of perſons in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick capacity and concernment, as Magiſtrates or Miniſters: but of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Relations, Kindred, Co-habitants, Neighbours, Friends, and Acquaintance, of ſuch as have frequent converſe together in Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and often commerce in dealings; but principally of Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Relatives, or ſuch as are nigh to each other by blood or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Saving-Converſion is in the power of God alone to effect, as being the primary and principal efficient cauſe of all thoſe gracious works that accompany ſalvation. There is none able to kindle Grace in the heart, but hee who hath his fire in <hi>Zion,</hi> and his furnace in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> Yet not withſtanding all of us in our ſeveral ſtations, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate inſtruments, may and muſt uſe all wholeſome means that are of Divine Appointment, conducing to ſuch a bleſſed end.</p>

That there are different ſtates, conditions, capacities and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications among ſuch Relations, whoſe converſion wee ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour. Some being perhaps enormouſly and outragiouſly wicked; others morally civil, and yet further, others poſſibly may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the inſtitutions of the external worſhip of God.

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> As to this I ſhall onely propoſe two particular Rules, which I cannot now handle largely.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This being the buſineſs of another ſubject, I ſhall onely ſay thus much, that if thou perceiveſt them by their haughty and ſcornful carriage to be ſuch as will kick at rebuke;<note place="margin">Prov. 9.8.</note> thou haſt a Rule from <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.

               </gap>] That's it, that very thing is it, which thou haſt ſpoken. As to our purpoſes, it is adviſeable, ſometimes not preſently and immediately to fall bluntly upon the work, leſt thou thy ſelf ſhouldeſt be in a paſſion. Yet ſtay not too long, leſt thy holy zeal be cooled; and both thou and hee forget or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Circumſtances, whereby Reproof might be the better fixed. A ſeaſonable time to intermeddle in theſe caſes may be when a friend is under the holy hand of God in any affliction, particularly in a ſick-bed. That time which is fit for bodily, may be much more fit for ſoul-phyſick. When thoughts of mortality, and the leaving of all outward enjoyments do prepare and meliorate the way for ſpiritual impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mix thy Reproofs with meek and gentle expreſſions. Every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof ſhould be like the <hi>Syrupus Acetoſus</hi> of Phyſicians, the Syrup of

The Chyrurgian, who hath taught his fingers too much tenderneſs, and not willing to put his patient to pain, may, through cruel kindneſs occaſion diſtorted limbs and lameneſs all a mans life. Corroſives are as neceſſary as glutinous plaiſters, to eat down the proud fleſh of our ſinful ſores. <hi>Ely</hi>'s ſinful mildneſs procured the ſharp ſword of the Philiſtines to cut off his Sons, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſuch diſmal events, that broke his own heart, and his neck too. In many Chymical operations; Salt is a moſt neceſſary ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and cauſes things to ferment; without the ſalt of Reproof in its due proportion, bare words of advice will ſeldome work. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the perſon muſt be wiſely conſidered. In ſome, too milde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions lull them aſleep in ſin. No great matter (may they think) which extorts but ſuch gentle reflections. In others, that are quick and apprehenſive: <hi>Soft words do pacifie wrath.</hi>

            <p>There are others who conſider this phraſe apart by it ſelf; ſome explaining it by <hi>purity of heart, and converſation;</hi> others as denoting thereby the <hi>duration of love [tam proſperis quam adverſis,</hi> or] both in good and bad times. <hi>Piſcator</hi> makes it a diſtinct branch of the Apoſtles Prayer, as if hee had ſaid, <hi>Grace bee with all them, &amp;c. and life eternal;</hi> Taking no notice of the Prepoſition that is added, and varies the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.

The Apoſtle doubtleſs meaning none elſe <hi>by lovers of Chriſt,</hi> but ſuch whoſe hearts were ſincerely and intirely affected, to him, whether hee intended to characterize them any further by [<gap reason="foreign">

And if that ſtand good, wee have enough for our purpoſe, and more need not bee contended for.</p>
            <p>Let this ſuffice then for their meaning. The ſubject matter of them, whether you look to the firſt clauſe, or the laſt, is very Noble, and might well deſerve a large conſideration; but I am confined to this ſingle uſe of them, which is, to make them <hi>the Foundation</hi> of theſe two caſes of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What are the genuine Characters of a Souls ſincere love to Chriſt?
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46545:100"/> And how may that love to him bee kindled and inflamed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there are but two or three things, that I deſire to ſuggeſt, and then wee ſhall immediately begin to treat upon them in their order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let it be conſidered, that there is a vaſt difference between theſe caſes, and ſuch others as do refer only to lower duties. When we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the <hi>ſincerity of our love to Christ.</hi> It's all one as if we were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſearch, whether we are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yea or not; And whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently our portion doth lye in the Divine Promiſes or Threatnings; And what is our <hi>immediate</hi> duty, that all other ſet aſide, we muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto? And again, when wee ſeek for directions to help us unto the <hi>love of Chriſt,</hi> our inquiry is not, how wee may order this or that inferiour action, but how wee may attain to <hi>ſaving Religion, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;</hi> How wee may eſcape the great damning ſin of the world, and intitle our ſelves to the love of God and Chriſt, and to all the <hi>rare</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, which belong to the Communion of Saints. In a word, to the <hi>Grace</hi> of God here, and to <hi>Eternal Life</hi> hereafter. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>James</hi> 1.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.5. <hi>John</hi> 14.21.23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it be conſidered, that it is not the diſtinct reſolution of theſe caſes that will be of <hi>final</hi> advantage to any perſon, unleſs there be added to the former an impartial ſoul-ſearching examination of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and to the latter, (as the caſe ſhall require) a conſcientious practice; The reſolutions given to caſes of conſcience about the right performance of duties, being nothing elſe, but the bare providing the food or phyſick; And again, the diſcoveries of mens ſtates thereby, being but the preſenting looking-glaſſes to them; neither of which are effectual, or do any good, but to ſuch as faithfully uſe them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let mee humbly minde you, that the more <hi>uncertainty</hi> you are at, touching your eſtates, when you have examined them by the <hi>Characters,</hi> the more diligence you are concerned to uſe in the practice of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</hi> And let mee add this, That where you cannot <hi>undeniably, and demonſtratively</hi> conclude, the ſincerity of your love (which I think few in compatiſon, on this ſide of Heaven can) there you muſt <hi>never</hi> lay by the advice about the laſt caſe; no not although your probabilities ſhould be great, it being at the worſt but an <hi>eaſie and ſweet trouble</hi> to be ſtill doing this great work over again, whereas it's <hi>irrecoverably dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſperate</hi> upon preſumption, that we have done it already, to leave it wholly neglected: And I beſeech you, remember this <hi>uſeful Rule,</hi> That in all Trials, which Chriſtians make about Grace, <hi>It is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to want credulity, than to be over haſty therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The caſes are two, and very fit to follow each other in the order,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46545:100"/> that is given to them. I begin with the firſt.</p>

               <p>Though <hi>the Love of God, and the Love of Chriſt</hi> are never found one without the other, yet is there a diſtinction <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and that, even as great in proportion, as is between <hi>God and the Mediatour,</hi> or between <hi>the laſt end, and the principal means conducing</hi> thereto.

The formal reaſon of the former, is the <hi>Divine All-ſufficiency and Bleſſedneſs,</hi> but of the latter the perſonal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies that are in Chriſt, together with his <hi>ability and willingneſs</hi> to free us from our undoing ſtreights, and exigencies, as wee are in a ſtate of <hi>Apoſtacy and elongation</hi> from God.

               <p>Love, as it is an Act or habit of the will, and hath Chriſt for its object, is not properly the Evangelical grace of love to Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it have reſpect to him, according to the various Excellencies of his perſon, and the ſeveral diſtinct Relations, which are by God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in him: Or thus, <hi>The goſpel grace of love, is not the Intenſive
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46545:101"/> willing a Naked Chriſt, but Chriſt as repreſented with his peculiar per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Excellencies, and with his various offices and relations unto us in the Goſpel.</hi> This propoſition undeniably follows from the <hi>third</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid down: But yet, becauſe it gives ſome <hi>ſpecial light</hi> to helpe us to diſcover the true nature of this grace; and is Intended, as the foundation of ſome of thoſe Characters, that will afterwards come to bee inſiſted on, I muſt crave <hi>your</hi> patience, while I offer ſomething farther, for the confirmation thereof. That certainly is no <hi>true Moral Act,</hi> which is not ſuited to the <hi>nature of the object;</hi> Thus, for a man to love <hi>his friend,</hi> no otherwiſe, than hee <hi>loves his beaſt,</hi> would not bee a true Moral act of love? And again, as plain a truth it is, that where the <hi>act of love</hi> doth not bear ſome <hi>gradual proportion,</hi> to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellencies of the object, that it is converſant about; neither can that <hi>Act</hi> have any <hi>Moral truth or goodneſs</hi> in it: For <hi>Inſtance,</hi> to <hi>love God, or Chriſt,</hi> with no higher love, than wee love inferior perſons, whether Friends, Relations, or Superiors in the world; This were not <hi>Sincerely to</hi> love either of them. See 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15, <hi>and Matth.</hi> 10.37. <hi>and Luke</hi> 14.26. — I add in the laſt place (which is no leſs evident, than either of the former) that where there are <hi>relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or offices Neceſſarily</hi> Inveſted in, and Inſeparable from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beloved, then if our love doth not reſpect the object, as under <hi>thoſe relations, and offices,</hi> it will bee far from being love in Sincerity. Some Inſtances will clear this alſo beyond Contradiction; Suppoſe a Woman, that hath a Husband, and ſhee loves him no otherwiſe, than one friend loves another; And the Caſe is the ſame between a <hi>Scholler and his Maſter,</hi> a <hi>Servant and his Lord,</hi> a <hi>Subject and his Prince,</hi> If the affections bee without reverence, obedience, and loyalty, will either of theſe bee reputed true love? Why, no more are ſuch to bee accounted the ſincere lovers of Chriſt, who do not bear <hi>an affection to him, in all his offices and relations:</hi> And this I take to bee ſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative a truth, and of ſuch Neceſſary conſideration in our preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that nothing could bee <hi>spoken in Judgement</hi> thereto, until wee had firſt made our way unto it, and laid it down; I am ſure it will bee found <hi>fundamental</hi> to the right underſtanding, the <hi>Nature of ſincere love to Chriſt,</hi> and the greateſt part of the Characters, which are laid down in the ſcripture of this grace. It might now bee here expected, and it's almoſt neceſſary to give ſome account of Chriſts perſonal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and alſo of his offices, what they were, and briefly to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate what new qualifications, each of them would put upon a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>Intenſive willing</hi> of Chriſt, which is but the [<hi>Substratum</hi> or]

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Characters, ſome I have omitted, and in others I have been brief, becauſe I would reſerve a little room for the ſecond Caſe: Give mee leave but briefly to ſuggeſt a few things for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of one doubt, and I ſhall preſently come to that. Will ſome ſay, If this bee love in ſincerity, <hi>who then loves him aright?</hi> It is no leſs dangerous to draw out the deſcription of a grace, ſo as none can finde it, than to leave it ſo, as <hi>none may ſuſpect</hi> the want or abſence thereof in themſelves; and upon that <hi>Rock,</hi> they will tell mee I have <hi>splitted</hi> in the deciſion of this Caſe, there being hardly any one that can go from Character to Character, and ſay after a thorough ſearch, <hi>Now I know that I am a lover of Chriſt in ſincerity:</hi> For anſwer to which ſcruple, I ſhall barely ſuggeſt a few Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is moſt certain, and notorious, that there is much <hi>counterfeit love</hi> abroad; and it was not the leaſt part of my deſign to unmask it. Characters ſerve as well to <hi>convince</hi> the preſumptuous, as to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> the ſincere and upright. There is much in the world, that looks like love, that is not; ſuch are thoſe <hi>Vagous</hi> affections, that are to a <hi>Chriſt in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> and not to him, as King, Prieſt, and Prophet; And thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit affections, which are to Chriſt upon the <hi>ſole</hi> Arguments of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, Cuſtome, which are as truly in a <hi>Turk</hi> to his <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and ſerve as well to <hi>juſtifie the Jew in his</hi> blaſphemy againſt Chriſt, as the Chriſtian in his pretended love of him; for love to Chriſt, <hi>ſay Divines,</hi> is not ſo much to bee meaſured by the degree, and fervour, as by the grounds and motives; And alſo that barren love, which works up the ſoul to no meaſure of obedience unto him; And laſtly, that which allows Chriſt but the worlds <hi>leavings</hi> in our hearts, every thing being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:46545:109"/> preferred before him: And what a vaſt number of perſons go no further than theſe?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Many perſons are truly gracious, who yet <hi>know</hi> not, whether they have any grace or not: It requires more <hi>skill</hi> to <hi>ſearch</hi> out the nature of a grace, and to finde it in our ſelves, than barely to exerciſe it; The former are works of much judgement, and require a <hi>deep acquaintance</hi> with our own hearts; whereas to the latter, it is enough, if a perſon bee but of an <hi>ordinary</hi> underſtanding, and an <hi>honeſt</hi> heart. Beſides Graces have their degrees,<note place="margin">Ezek. 47.3, 4, 5</note> like the waters of the Sanctuary, and where <hi>grace</hi> is very <hi>ſhallow and little,</hi> it is <hi>exceeding difficult</hi> to know that there is <hi>any</hi> at all: And ſuch perſons ſhould do well, who are ſo weak, rather <hi>to spend t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me in the exerciſe of grace,</hi> than in trying whether they have grace or no, for commonly <hi>it is but labour in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are no ſouls in whom this grace is really planted, but they have all theſe Characters drawn upon their hearts to know it by, more or leſs; I do not ſay, they <hi>can finde</hi> them in themſelves, and <hi>know they</hi> have them, but onely that they have them. And of this I need give no further evidence, than what you will eaſily finde your ſelves, if you will but ſtudy the nature of love to Chriſt, by the Rule of it laid down in the fifth Propoſition premiſed, and by the third and fourth Characters; for I am well aſſured that Chriſt cannot bee loved, as therein deſcribed, unleſs all theſe particulars mentioned, be either antecedent thereto, or connexed with it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I will diſcover the danger of being without this grace.</p>

               <p n="4">4. I will add a few more Directions for them that have it, how it may be increaſed and inflamed?</p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt, which I will diſpatch by theſe two ſteps. 1. By diſcovering the Hainouſneſs of Sin. 2. The Terrour of the Puniſhment due thereto.</p>
               <p>Now that you may underſtand the firſt, beſides what hath been ſaid <hi>in the fore-mentioned Tract,</hi> proving it to be a ſin <hi>againſt the Fathers love and wiſdome; the whole work of the Son, and the ſpecial oeconomy of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> I add firſt it's a ſin utterly <hi>ſubverting the whole</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46545:109"/> of the Goſpel, caſting <hi>a ſcorn</hi> upon the grace of all the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not ſo much as acknowledging what was done by them, as worthy the leaſt acceptance; it writes <hi>vanity</hi> upon all the promiſes, and is a <hi>fruſtration</hi> to the deſign of Chriſt in that <hi>Noble Diſpenſation,</hi> there being nothing that he did more aim at, than to teſtifie his own,<note place="margin">John 3.17. 1 John 1.3.</note> and his Fathers love to us, and to recover from us our love to them again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is <hi>interpretatively a confederacy with Satan againſt God and Chriſt;</hi> The proper and grand wickedneſs of the Devil,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.24.

If wee with-hold our hearts from him; And can ſuch a ſin after all this be extenuated?</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is <hi>a ſin brought forth, and nurſed by the fouleſt abominations,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. I argue it from the <hi>Terrour of the Puniſhment:</hi> And certainly the <hi>Juſt God</hi> hath proportioned the <hi>evil of this,</hi> to the <hi>quality of that.</hi> Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy well theſe few places of Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.41. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.28, 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. throughout. Oh the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Lord, that will one day bee <hi>heaped upon</hi> the haters of his Son! See <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.16. But wee need not look any further for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than <hi>into the awakened conſcience</hi> of a <hi>Rebel</hi> againſt Chriſt in a fit of deſperation: what <hi>Scorpion-laſhes</hi> doth ſuch a mans conſcience give him? Oh the heat of this burning Caldron! with what rage and fury doth it break forth on every ſide, until the ſoul is even become <hi>a Hell</hi> to it ſelf! And <hi>wouldeſt thou not love Chriſt</hi> (will inraged conſcience then ſay) ſo lovely in himſelf, and ſo full of love to thee? Couldeſt thou ſee him <hi>ſighing, bleeding, ſweating, dying</hi> for thy ſake, and yet not love him? Couldeſt thou ſpurn at ſuch <hi>bowels,</hi> and contemn ſuch <hi>prodigious</hi> mercy? and that when this love would have opened to thee, the door of <hi>glory?</hi> how great? how infinite glory? and when the rejecting of it would infallibly plunge thy ſoul into miſery? how dreadful, how intollerable? was ever madneſs like thine, <hi>oh my ſoul,</hi> will <hi>conſcience</hi> ſay? certainly Hell is too eaſie a puniſhment for ſuch a <hi>Serpent,</hi> ſuch an <hi>Incarnate Devil</hi> as thou art; well may God rejoyce to bee avenged on ſuch a wretch as thee, and make thee to drink up the very dreggs of his Indignation; while others that <hi>dwell in God,</hi> ſhall dwell in love, oh how will God bee nothing elſe, but fury, and wrath, and vengeance to thee? Thou ſhalt <hi>one day</hi> (and <hi>that day</hi> ſuch as <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> ſhall have an end) hear Juſtice call upon Omnipotency ſtill to add more flame to thy torment? Thus conſcience will look backward, and forward, and even wreak it ſelf with the moſt diſmal flaming lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that it can finde out, upon the haters of Chriſt; And is not that a dreadful ſin, which ſhall thus ſet <hi>a man againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</hi> and put a ſword into the hand of <hi>cruel conſcience</hi> to cleave the ſoul in peeces? And is not that a dreadful puniſhment, when a man ſhall become his own <hi>Accuſer, Judge, and Executioner?</hi> When conſcience ſhall burn ſo hot within a man, that hee ſhall be a terrour to himſelf, and an eternal amazement?

               <p>Conſider 1. Who it is that I plead for this day: Sirs I do not call you to doat upon thick clay, filth, and vanity: I do not plead to gain your hearts to one that is not <hi>worthy,</hi> or hath not <hi>deſerved</hi> that you ſhould place your affections upon him; if you can make either of theſe manifeſt, hate him and ſpare not; but I plead for one who is 1. glorious, and excellent, if you doubt it read his Character, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9. <hi>What ſayeſt thou now,</hi> is hee not <hi>Altogether lovely?</hi> is there any blemiſh to bee found in him? and if thou miſtruſteſt the Judgement of the Church, ſure thou canſt not doubt of Gods; Hear his ſentence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Hee knew <hi>of whom</hi> hee ſpake, for hee <hi>was his Son;</hi> and hee doth not ſay, hee was pleaſed with him only, but well-pleaſed, i. e. delighted, (<hi>See Prov.</hi> 8.30.) and ſatisfied. And was hee <hi>worthy of Gods love,</hi> and doeſt thou doubt, whether he have deſerved thine? 2. Conſider, hee is one that <hi>died</hi> for thee; firſt to purchaſe thy love, and ſince is gone to Heaven, where yet hee doth not <hi>Ceaſe</hi> to call upon thee, and Invite thee to beſtow thy heart upon him; were hee excellent, but proud, it would bee little to thy advantage; But hee ſtoops, and wooes, and intreats thee.<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.1.

               <p>Conſider 1. The love of Chriſt to thee was <hi>a growing, Increaſing</hi> love; I do not mean, in reſpect of the <hi>habit,</hi> but in the outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration thereof. The neerer hee was to his death, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberant in love, and when hee roſe again his heart did overflow with tender indulgence, as appears by the meltings of his bowels towards <hi>Mary,</hi> and over <hi>Peter;</hi> and much more may wee beleeve him now to be full of them, now that hee is at the Right hand of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is more <hi>lovelyneſs</hi> in Chriſt, than ever thou canſt finde out or fathome; when wee have let out our affections to the utmoſt, there will ſtill bee more than wee can finde affection for; our love to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity will have ſomething <hi>of admiration</hi> mixed with it.</p>

                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:46545:112"/>3. It's all you can return to him; it's all hee looks for at our hands; that which <hi>lies in love,</hi> and which <hi>flowes from it,</hi> is the whole, that is required to compleat Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The more you love him, the more lovely you are unto him. Then hath Chriſt the higheſt complacency in us, when our hearts are under the <hi>greatest Raptures</hi> of love to him.</p>

               <hi>The great rule of equity in all our dealings with men, is this, to do as we would bee done unto;</hi> This Rule hath been otherwiſe expreſt, but not more emphatically in any other form of words than this here in the Text; <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.39. <hi>Love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that wee ſhould bear the ſame <hi>affection</hi> to our Neighbour which wee would have him bear to us, but the <hi>Rule</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that wee ſhould do the ſame <hi>offices</hi> to others, which wee would have them do to us. <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour (as the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Lampridius.</note>) did learn this rule of Chriſtians, and did much reverence Chriſt, and Chriſtianity for it, but hee expreſt it negatively, <hi>Quod tibi non vis, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri ne feceris;</hi> Now this forbids us to do injuries to others, but doth not ſo expreſly command us to do kindeneſſes and courteſies.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to this Rule, I ſhall give you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Explication</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Grounds</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Inſtances</hi> wherein wee ought, principally to practice it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>Explication,</hi> the meaning of it is this; Put thy ſelf into the Caſe and circumſtances of every man, with whom thou haſt to do, that is, ſuppoſe thou wert hee and as hee is, and hee were thy ſelf and as thou art; that then which thou wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ldeſt deſire hee ſhould do to thee, that do thou to him; and that which thou wouldeſt bee unwilling hee ſhould do to thee, do not thou do to him. Now this is an <hi>exact</hi> rule, for wee are very curious in determining our own privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and what duty others owe to us; juſt ſo much as wee take to our ſelves, wee muſt allow to others; what wee expect from others when wee are in ſuch circumſtances, wee muſt do the ſame to them in the like. And this is a <hi>plain</hi> and eaſie rule, many men cannot tell, what is Law or Juſtice, or right in ſuch a Caſe, many cannot deduce the Laws of nature one from another, but there is no man, but can tell what it is that hee would have another man do to him; every man can take his own actions, and put them into the other ſcale, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if this that I do now to another, were to bee done to mee, ſhould I like it, ſhould I bee pleaſed, and contented with it; And thus by changing the ſcales, his own ſelf-love, and ſelf-intereſt, and other paſſions, will add nothing to the weight, for that ſelf-intereſt which makes a man covetous, and inclines him to wrong another man for his own advantage, makes him likewiſe (when the ſcales are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) unwilling that another man ſhould wrong him; that ſelf-conceit which makes a man proud, and apt to ſcorn, and deſpiſe others,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:46545:115"/> makes him unwilling that another ſhould contemn him.</p>
            <p>I queſtion not but by this time, you underſtand the meaning of the rule; but wee are not yet paſt all difficulties about it; Three things are to be done, before this rule will bee of uſe to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wee muſt make it appear that it is <hi>reaſonable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Make it <hi>certain,</hi> for till it bee certain it cannot bee a rule.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Make it <hi>practicable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Wee muſt make it appear to bee <hi>reaſonable;</hi> The difficulty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the reaſonableneſs of it is this; according to this rule I ſhall bee obliged to do that many times, which is ſinful, and to omit that which is a neceſſary duty; I will give two or three inſtances; <hi>Saul</hi> would have had his Armor-bearer, to have kill'd him, might hee therefore have kill'd his Armor-bearer if hee had been willing, and had deſired it? I may not bee an inſtrument, or furtherer of another mans ſin, though I were ſo wicked as to deſire that another would bee ſo to mee; If I were a Childe, I would not have my Father correct mee; or a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, I would not have the Magiſtrate cut mee off; muſt there therefore bee no correction, or puniſhment? Now becauſe of theſe, and the like inſtances which may bee given, the rule is neceſſarily to bee underſtood of things that may bee done, or omitted, i. e. which are not unlawful or unreaſonable; <hi>Saul</hi> might not kill his Armor-bearer, I may not further another mans ſin, in the caſes propounded, becauſe theſe things may not bee done, they are Morally impoſſible, that is, unlawful; A Parent or a Magiſtrate, may not wholly omit Correction or Puniſhment, becauſe ſuch omiſſion would tend to the ruine of good manners and of humane Society.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wee muſt make the rule <hi>Certain;</hi> The difficulty about the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it, is this; everlaſting diſputes will ariſe about what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and reaſonable, and unlawful, and unreaſonable; Now we muſt reduce it, to a certainty thus; what ever I would that another ſhould do to me, that I ſhould do to him, unleſs the thing bee <hi>plainly,</hi> &amp; <hi>evidently</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful or unreaſonable; &amp; this cuts off all diſputes, for though there may be perpetual diſputes about what is lawful &amp; reaſonable, or the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet there can be no diſpute about the unlawfulneſs &amp; unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe things which are plainly and evidently ſo, for that which is plain and evident, is out of all diſpute; To confirm this let us conſider another Text. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. Where the Apoſtle exhorts Chriſtians to follow whatever things are <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>honeſt,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> and as a diſcovery of what things are ſuch; hee adds what ever things are <hi>lovely,</hi> of <hi>good report,</hi> and <hi>praiſe worthy;</hi> that is, what ever things are amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46545:115"/> well ſpoken of, and praiſed by wiſe and good men (who are the only competent Judges of theſe things) if they bee not plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to truth or honeſty, or juſtice, or purity, follow theſe thing; and if this bee not the meaning, thoſe words <hi>lovely,</hi> of <hi>good report, praiſe worthy</hi> are ſuperfluous, and do not at all direct our converſation, which certainly the Apoſtle intended to do by them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wee muſt make it <hi>practicable;</hi> There are two things which make the practiſe of it difficult.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A ſeeming <hi>contradiction</hi> in the rule.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Partiality</hi> in judging of the circumſtances of other mens condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and our own.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A ſeeming <hi>Contradiction</hi> in the rule; which you will ſee in theſe inſtances; if I deſire a thing, I would not have another ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with mee for it, if another deſire a thing, I would not have him think much, that I ſtand in competition with him; if I bee indebted to another, I would not have him arreſt mee; if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee indebted to mee, I would not have him think much that I arreſt him; when wee ſell wee care not how dear, when wee buy wee care not how cheap; now if this were a real contradiction in the rule, it were impoſſible it ſhould bee put in practice, but it is only a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in our <hi>wills,</hi> which muſt thus bee reconciled to the <hi>rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Wee muſt conſider which of theſe wills, is moſt reaſonable, and the greater reaſon and equity muſt carry it, and that which is plainly unreaſonable, in compariſon of the other, is not to bee regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; If wee conſider the two firſt inſtances, this is moſt reaſonable that where men have an equal right, they ſhould bee allowed an equal liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to uſe that right; another man hath as much right to ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with mee for any thing, as I to ſtand in competition with him, and to arreſt mee in caſe of debt as I to arreſt him, and it is plainly unreaſonable that I ſhould uſe this right and another bee debarred from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If both theſe Contradictory wills, bee plainly unreaſonable as in the third inſtance of buying and ſelling, they muſt bee <hi>accommodated</hi> by finding out ſuch a <hi>medium</hi> as is <hi>equally and mutually</hi> good for all buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſellers, that is, ſuch a proportion of gain may bee taken and muſt bee allowed to bee taken, as will bee equally and mutually good for all buyers and ſellers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another difficulty in the practiſe of this rule, ariſeth from mens <hi>partiality</hi> in judgeing of the circumſtances of other mens conditions and their own; wee are apt to leſſen the circumſtances of another
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46545:116"/> mans condition, and to over-value our own; another mans concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeem leſs to us than they are, and our own greater than they are. Now this difficulty will moſt eminently appear in <hi>Caſes</hi> of <hi>paſſion,</hi> &amp; <hi>intereſt,</hi> and thoſe <hi>ſubordinate relations,</hi> which are at the greateſt diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; another man provokes mee, I revenge my ſelf on him; one askes mee, would you bee contented to bee thus dealt withall; I am ready to anſwer, yea, if I ſhould ſo provoke another; I aggravate the fault of his provocation, and leſſen that of my own revenge, here is <hi>paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> I deſire a courteſie of a man which hee cannot conveniently do for mee, hee denies mee, I think much at him, becauſe I judge the <hi>courteſie leſs,</hi> and <hi>his obligation</hi> to do it <hi>greater,</hi> than indeed it is; here is <hi>intereſt;</hi> I think if I were a Father, I ſhould not carry my ſelf ſo ſeverely towards my Children; if I were a Maſter, I ſhould give more liberty to ſervants, and uſe them with a greater familiarity; if I were a Miniſter, I ſhould not gall the conſciences of people by ſo free and open a reproof of ſin; if I were a Magiſtrate, I ſhould make other laws, or puniſh ſome crimes more or leſs, ſeverely: Now if men frequently thus miſ-judge, how ſhall this rule bee put in practiſe?</p>
            <p>To remove theſe difficulties, as much as may bee, and to make the practiſe of this Rule more eaſie; obſerve theſe rules,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Labour to underſtand truly every mans condition, ſo far as you have opportunity; this is eaſily ſaid, but how ſhall wee come to do it? Thus, when you are in any condition, obſerve diligently the motions of your own minde, and how your affections then work, and what apprehenſions, you then have of things, and what it is that in ſuch a condition you deſire, and expect from others; and labour to remember this when you are out of that condition, and to retain the fenſe which you then had of things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In caſes wherein you are unexperienced, and which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably bee preſumed to underſtand, partly becauſe of your diſtance from that condition, partly becauſe of the oppoſition of your own intereſt; and partly becauſe of the miſts, and clouds, of your own paſſion; truſt the concurrent experience of others, that are in that condition; and think that you ought not to do that to another, which the generality of mankinde count grievous, and that fit to bee done, which the moſt, and wiſeſt in ſuch a condition and relation, do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expect. If men when they are under, and lye at the mercy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, generally deſire that clemency, and moderation ſhould bee uſed towards them, how juſt ſoever thou mayeſt think thy ſeverity is, and that thou wouldeſt bee contented, that another ſhould deal ſo
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46545:116"/> with thee, yet do not truſt thy preſent apprehenſions of things, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that thou wilt have the ſame ſence of things, when they lye hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon thee, with the reſt of man-kind, and when thou art in their circumſtances, thou wilt deſire quarter as they do; In like manner, that reſpect and obedience which Parents, and Maſters, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, do generally expect (even the beſt and wiſeſt of them) that do thou pay to them; and though it may have ſome appearance of rigour, and injuſtice, yet beleeve that when thou comeſt to bee in the ſame relation, thou wilt expect the ſame things as they do; and that thou doſt now judge otherwiſe, proceeds from thy inexperience, and diſtance from that condition, or from paſſion and oppoſition of intereſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conclude, that in caſes betwixt Superiours and Inferiours, the partiality is uſually on the Inferiours ſide; and it is reaſonable thus to conclude, both becauſe Inferiours have ſeldome had experience of the other condition, as ſuperiours uſually have had; a childe hath not been a Parent, or a ſervant ordinarily a Maſter, or a ſubject a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; but all Parents have been children, and moſt Maſters have been ſervants, and many Magiſtrates ſubjects, and ſo they have had experience of both conditions; And likewiſe becauſe Inferiours cannot ſo well ſee the condition and circumſtances of thoſe that are above them, as thoſe that are above can of thoſe that are below them, they have the advantage of ground, and better opportunities of knowledge.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In judging of your preſent condition and circumſtances, alwaies abate ſome thing for the preſence of them, and for ſelf-love, and ſelf-intereſt, and other paſſions. Hee that doth not conſider how apt every man is unequally to favour himſelf, doth not know the littleneſs and narrowneſs of humane nature. Wee are neer to our ſelves, and our own intereſt is neer to us, and wee ſee it in its full proportions, and with all poſſible advantages, other men and their intereſts are at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from us, and ſeem leſs to us than they are. Now wee muſt make abatements for this, according to that experience which wee have had of our own miſtakes, which, if wee will obſerve, as wee paſs from one condition into another, wee may eaſily bee convinced how great many times they are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the <hi>grounds</hi> of this. The equity of this Rule ſtands upon theſe foundations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All men are equal in many things, and thoſe the greateſt things. Now I ſhould deal equally with him, whom I acknowledge to bee mine equal. <hi>Have wee not all one Father, hath not one God created us?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 2.10.</note> Are wee not all made of the ſame materials?<note place="margin">Heb. 9.27.</note> 
               <hi>Is it not appointed for all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46545:117"/> men once to dye,</hi> and after death to ſtand before the impartial judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God? Wee have all the ſame notions of right and wrong, wee are all obnoxious to one another, and may bee all beneficial one to another; wee all love our ſelves, and ſtudy the advancement of our intereſt and happineſs. Thus far equal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In most of thoſe things wherein wee are unequal, the inequality is not conſiderable,</hi> ſo as to bee a ground of any unequal dealing with one another. As to <hi>ſtrength of body,</hi> whatever the difference bee, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality is not conſiderable, becauſe as to the greateſt effects of ſtrength there is an equality; every man that will venture his own life, may take away another mans,<note place="margin">Dominus eſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius vitae quicun<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnit ſuam.</note> either by open force, or by ſurprize. <hi>As to abilities of mind</hi> (which wee uſually call <hi>parts</hi>) there is <hi>originally</hi> a great equality, eſpecially if that received <hi>Opinion</hi> bee true, that <hi>ſouls are equal;</hi> And as the <hi>French</hi> Philoſopher <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath ingeniouſly obſerved,<note place="margin">Diſſertat. de Methodo.</note> there is this notable ſign of the equality of mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; <hi>Nulla res</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>aequabilius inter homines diſtributa eſt quam bona mens, &amp;c. Nothing is more equally divided among men than a good underſtanding; Men will acknowledge others to bee richer and ſtronger than themſelves, few will acknowledge others to bee wiſer, or to have better parts than themſelves; every man thinks himſelf to have ſo good a proportion of parts and wiſdome, that even thoſe who are moſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and have the moſt inſatiable deſires as to other things, and whom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could never ſatisfie in any thing elſe,</hi>

               <hi>yet would not deſire to have more wit than they have, or exchange their parts with any man.</hi> Now there is no better ſign of an equal diſtribution of things than that every man is contented with his ſhare. <hi>Now becauſe all men generally think thus, it is to be preſumed that all are not deceived, but that there is ſome real equality, which is the ground of this conceit.</hi> A difference indeed muſt bee granted, but which ariſeth uſually from one of theſe two cauſes, either an <hi>unequal exerciſe of our parts,</hi> or <hi>an unequal temper of body.</hi> Now thoſe who are ſo happy, as to exerciſe their underſtandings more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are very often rather conceited that they are wiſer than others, than really ſo; <hi>for the greateſt Clerks are not alwaies the wiſeſt men;</hi> thoſe who are unhappy in the temper of their bodies, are thereby inclined how weak ſoever they be, to conceit themſelves as wiſe as others. So that whatever real inequality there be, conceit levels all again. So that whether men be really wiſe, or only think themſelves ſo, it makes no difference as to mens dealing with one another, for they that think themſelves equal,<note place="margin">Politic. c. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> will not deal but upon equal terms; So that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>les</hi> pretty notion, that <hi>wiſe men are born to govern, and fools to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46545:117"/> obey,</hi> ſignifies very little in this caſe, for there are but few ſuch fools in the world, but would govern if they can: So that by vertue of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or parts, no man can challenge a priviledge, or prerogative to himſelf above others, which another will not pretend to, as well as hee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In all thoſe things wherein men are unequal, the inequality is not fixt and constant, but mutable and by turns.</hi> All things that belong to us are either the <hi>endowments</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> the <hi>accidents</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> or the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of our <hi>outward eſtate;</hi> Now thoſe that are moſt unequal in any of theſe, may bee equal, or the inequality may turn and bee as much on the other ſide. A diſeaſe may ruine the moſt happy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>memory,</hi> and make a man forget his own name; a little knock on any ſide of the head, may level the higheſt <hi>underſtanding</hi> with the meaneſt; <hi>beauty, health</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> may bee blaſted by a diſeaſe, or a thouſand other accidents; <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> are the moſt ſlippery and brittle things that belong to us, and when theſe are gone, <hi>friends</hi> will fall off, like leaves in <hi>Autumn.</hi> Now why ſhould I deſpiſe another man, when I may be as ſilly as hee; or bear down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by my ſtrength, when I may be as weak as hee; or inſult over anothers poor and low condition, when a day may level mee with his meanneſs, and raiſe him to be as great and rich as I am?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another ground is, <hi>the mutual and univerſal equity and advantage of this. Rule.</hi> Upon thoſe terms I and all men ſhall be equally dealt with, it will be well with mee, and well with all men. The obſervation of this Rule would ſecure peace to the world, and if it were generally practiſed, thoſe few that ſhould offend againſt it, would be looked upon as the peſts and troublers of humane ſociety. As by the violation of this Rule, every man becomes <hi>a Wolf,</hi> and <hi>beaſt of prey</hi> to another, ſo by the mutual obſervation of it, every man would bee <hi>a God</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; men would bee full mutual goodneſs, and pitty, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they would bee mutual benefactors one to another; All men would bee as happy as it is poſſible for them to bee in this world, and no man could bee miſerable if it were in the power of his neighbour to help him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The laſt ground I ſhall mention is, <hi>the abſurdity and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the moſt proper way of proving this; for as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, <hi>Firſt Principles which are evident by their own light, cannot bee proved by way of demonſtration,</hi> but of <hi>conviction;</hi> As thus; <hi>contradictions cannot bee true at once;</hi> This cannot be demonſtrated <hi>a priori,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46545:118"/> there is nothing true before it to prove it by; therefore whoever ſhall deny it, muſt bee convinced of the truth of it, by ſhewing the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the contrary. In like manner this being one of the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of humane ſociety, that wee ſhould uſe no more liberty towards other men, than wee would allow them to uſe towards us; the beſt way to convince any man of the reaſonableneſs and equity of it, will bee to ſhew him the inconveniences of the contrary. Where-ever this Principle is violated, men will think themſelves injured; where men are injured, they will bee apt to vindicate themſelves; hence comes contention and warrs, which looſe the bands of humane ſociety; or if a man can pardon an injury, that hath received one, yet hee that hath done it cannot beleeve ſo, but hee will fear revenge, and fear of being oppreſt, makes a man ſeek to anticipate and prevent another, ſo that every injury endangers the peace and ſecurity of mankind, and laies the foundation of perpetual miſchief; for by the ſame reaſon that I injure any man, I am obliged to ruine him.</p>
            <p>Hee that breaks this Rule, doth what hee can to break humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; that is, to ſpoil himſelf of all common protection, and to leave himſelf to ſtand upon his guard againſt all the world; in which ſtate no man can hope to continue, that is not wiſer and ſtronger than all the world.<note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, <hi>Hee that deſires to bee alone, muſt either bee a God, or a wilde beaſt;</hi> that is, hee muſt either be ſelf-ſufficient, and ſtand in need of nothing, or elſe be wilde and ſavage, and delight in cruelty, and miſchief.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Inſtances</hi> wherein wee ought chiefly to practiſe this Rule, are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In matters of <hi>civil reſpect and converſation.</hi> I muſt treat every man with that fair reſpect which I would have another to ſhew to mee. Wee muſt accommodate our ſelves to mens particular tempers, and nor bee froward or intractable, or tenacious of our own humour, eſpecially when it lyes in another mans way, but wee muſt be apt to recede and give way, that there may be room for other mens tempers and humours, as well as ours; our humour muſt not take up all the world. Thoſe who want this <hi>compleaſance,</hi> are in ſociety (as one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly compares them) like irregular ſtones in a building, which are full of roughneſs and corners; they <hi>take</hi> up more room than they <hi>fill,</hi> till they bee poliſht and made even, others cannot lye neer them: ſo men of ſharp and perverſe humours are unſociable, till the rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and aſperities of their nature be taken off. Wee muſt not carry our ſelves inſolently, or ſuperciliouſly, or contemptuouſly towards
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46545:118"/> others; we muſt not be contumelious, not by deed or word, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or geſture, declare hatred, or contempt or others. We muſt not upbraid one another with any imperfection, or weakneſs, or deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wee muſt not peremptorily contradict others, wee muſt not uſe to talk things diſpleaſing to others, wherein their credit, or relations, or (eſpecially their Religion) is concerned; <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith, this was one of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Laws (it was a good one whoſe ever it was) <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> 
               <hi>Let no man blaſpheme that which other Nations count a God,</hi> or make their Religion. Not but that every man may confute a falſe Religion, and indeavour by all fair waies to convince a Jew, or Turk, or Heathen, but wee may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach another mans Religion, or provoke any man in ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, by unſeaſonable and uncivil reflections upon it; for wee are with meekneſs to convince gain-ſayers, to reprove men for their ſins, but not to upbraid them with them: Wee muſt give no offence to the Jew, or to the Gentile, remembring alwaies that the wrath of man doth not work the Righteouſneſs of God; and that <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, when hee conrended with the Devil, did not bring a railing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt him; hee did not revile him, no not in heat of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. And there is great reaſon why wee ſhould thus carry our ſelves towards others, becauſe wee our ſelves would not bee contemned or deſpiſed, wee would not have any man jeer us, or inſult over us, or upbraid us, or peeviſhly contradict us, or affront us by ſpeaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomely of us, or of our Relations, or of our Religion. Now if we would have others to conſider us, wee muſt not neglect them; if wee would be taken notice of for ſome body, wee muſt not over-look o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with contempt; every thing thinks it ſelf conſiderable, and there is nothing comes ſooner to us, or continues longer with us, than a ſenſe of our own worth; and wee judge ill of humane nature, if wee think another man is not as impatient of rude and uncivil uſage as wee are; nothing would bee deſpiſed, a worm would not bee trod upon; nay, men do uſually over-value themſelves, and are apt to think that they are owners of that ſingular worth, which may command reſpect from all men, and that every one that paſſeth by ought to fall down, and do obeyſance to them; they have <hi>Joſephs dream</hi> waking, they think <hi>all mens ſheaves bow to their ſheaves;</hi> they think every man takes notice of them, and obſerves their carriage and actions, when probably not one of a thouſand ever took them into conſideration; or ask who they were; Now wee muſt conſider, that it is a hundred to one but there is a little of this vanity in us alſo, and that wee do uſually look for more
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46545:119"/> reſpect than is due, therefore it will not bee amiſſe in our reſpects towards others, <hi>largiri aliquid,</hi> to give men ſomething above wee think they deſerve, and the rather becauſe civil reſpect is cheap, and coſts us nothing, and wee expect from others full as much as comes to our ſhare; for it is a miſtake to think that we do but righteouſly eſteem our ſelves, and that wee have no more than a juſt value of our own worth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In matters of <hi>kindneſs</hi> and <hi>courteſies,</hi> we muſt be uſeful to one another, I would have no man churliſh to mee, but ready to gratifie me, and do me a kindneſs. Do I think much to be denied a reaſonable favour, and doth not another ſo too? we would have all men love us, that is, bear ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to us, that when it falls in their way, they ſhould be ready to do us a courteſie. We would not have courteſies done in a diſcourteous manner, extorted by importunity, or upbraided to us afterwards. Let us likewiſe diſpenſe favours with a liberal hand, and a chearful countenance, that men may ſee that they come from a kind heart, and a real good will.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In matters of <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>compaſsion,</hi> if any man be in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, pitty him, and help him to your power; if any be in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and want, contribute to his relief, without too ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous inquiries about him; for we would be thus dealt with our ſelves, we would not have others to harden their hearts, or ſhut up their bowels of compaſſion againſt us. Is any man caſt down? do not inſult over him, and trample upon him, do not look upon him with ſcorn, and rejoyce over him in the day of diſtreſs. <hi>Res eſt ſacra miſer, perſons in miſery are ſacred, and not to be violated;</hi> When you ſee any man in calamity, think ye hear him ſay to you with <hi>Job, I alſo could ſpeak as you do, if your ſoul were in my ſoule ſtead, I could heap up words againſt you, and ſhake mine head at you, but I would ſtrengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips ſhould aſſwage your grief,</hi> Job 16.4, 5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In matter of <hi>forbearance;</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs;</hi> We ſtand in need of forbearance and pardon from others, from God and men; we ſhould be loath God ſhould take advantage againſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46545:119"/> us upon every provocation, and let fly at us with a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt every time we offend him. We would not have men ſtorm and fall into paſſion with us upon every ſleight occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I would have great allowances given to mee, I would have my <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>inadvertency,</hi> and <hi>miſtakes,</hi> and <hi>preſent temper,</hi> and all <hi>occaſions</hi> and <hi>provocations,</hi> and every thing conſidered. And when I have done amiſs, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of my fault, I would be forgiven and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to favour. Now if we would be thus dealt with, we muſt bear with others; the beſt men need ſome grains of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance; <hi>Nullum unquam ingenium placuit ſine veniâ;</hi> no man was ever ſo perfect, ſo accompliſht, ſo unexceptionable, but there was ſome thing or other in his carriage that needed pardon; every man hath a particular humour, we muſt give ſome allowance for that; every man is ſubject to miſtake, we muſt allow for that too; and if a man have committed a fault, we muſt accept of an ingenuous acknowledgement, and be ready to grant him peace: There is a ſhame and diſdain in humane nature of too vile a ſubmiſſion; therefore we muſt not bring a man too low when we have him at advantage.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In matter of <hi>report</hi> and <hi>repreſentation</hi> of other <hi>men,</hi> and their <hi>actions.</hi> We muſt not take up a raſh prejudice or entertain a ſiniſter apprehenſion of any upon ſleight grounds; do not repreſent any man, his words or actions at a diſadvantage; make the beſt of every thing; A mans good Name is like a Looking-glaſſe, nothing is ſooner crackt, and every breath can ſully it. Handle every mans reputation with the ſame tenderneſs thou wouldeſt have every man uſe towards thine. Do not ſlander or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame any man, or rejoyce to hear other mens miſcarriages ript open, do not account it an entertainment to cenſure and backbite all the World.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In matters of <hi>truſt</hi> and <hi>fidelity.</hi> Where I place a confidence, and repoſe a truſt, I would not bee deceived, I muſt not deceive another, nor let any man fall that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46545:120"/> leans upon mee. If a man truſt mee with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his buſineſſe, or lodge a ſecret with mee, or put his life into my power, or commit the care of his eſtate or children to mee after his death. Theſe are all ingenuous truſts, and muſt be diſcharged with the ſame faithfulneſs we expect from others.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In matter of <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>obedience;</hi> Wee muſt give that honour to our Parents, which wee would expect from our Children; and pay that reverence to Maſters, which wee would exact from our Servants; Wee muſt riſe up before the gray head, and give reſpect to old Age? For let not us think, but that the change of <hi>Relation,</hi> and of <hi>Age</hi> will have the ſame effect upon us, which it hath upon the reſt of the World: It is a folly to talk, that when wee are <hi>Old,</hi> wee ſhall be pleaſed with the inſolencies of <hi>Youth;</hi> when wee are Maſters, wee ſhall not be at all offended with the contemptuous carriage of our Servants; that it will not touch our hearts, to have our Children undutiful, and void of reſpect, to ſee the fruit of our body, unnatural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nde to us.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In matters of <hi>freedome</hi> and <hi>liberty;</hi> Which are not determined by any natural or poſitive Law, wee muſt permit as much to others, as wee aſſume to our ſelves; and this is a ſign of an equal, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon and one that juſtly values his own underſtanding and power. But there is nothing wherein men uſually deal more unequally with one another, than in indifferent opinions and practices of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I account that an indifferent opinion which good men differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, not that ſuch an opinion is indifferent as to truth or errour, but as to ſalvation or damnation, it is not of neceſſary beleef; By an indifferent practice in Religion, I mean that which is in its own nature, neither a duty, nor a ſin to do or omit. Where I am left free, I would not have any m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to rob mee of my liberty, or intrench upon my freedome, and becauſe hee is ſatisfied, ſuch a thing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and fit to be done, expect I ſhould do it, who think it otherwiſe, or becauſe hee is confident ſuch an opinion is true, be angry with mee, becauſe I cannot beleeve as faſt as hee. Now if another do ill, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus to mee, I cannot do well in doing ſo to another. And do not ſay that thou art ſure thou art in the right, and he that differs from thee in the wrong, and therefore thou mayeſt impoſe upon him, though hee may not upon thee; hath not every man this confidence of his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and practice, and uſually the weakeſt cauſe bears up with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt confidence; now if thou wouldeſt not have another that is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46545:120"/> hee is in the right, to impoſe upon thee, do not thou impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another for all thy confidence. Wee ſhould rather bee modeſt, and ſay every one to our ſelves; <hi>How came I to be ſo much wiſer then other men, which way came the ſpirit of the Lord, from ſo many Wiſe and Pious men, to ſpeak unto mee? Is it a peculiar priviledge granted to mee, that I cannot bee miſtaken, or are not they moſt of all miſtaken, who think they cannot miſtake? If then I bee but like other men, why ſhould I take ſo much upon mee, as if my underſtanding were to bee a rule, and my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions a ſtandard to the whole World? As if when another man differs from mee, I did not differ as much from him; why may not another man underſtand the thing better than I do, or what crime is it if hee underſtand it not ſo well? Were all mens underſtandings caſt in the ſame Mould? Is it preſumption for any man to know more then I do, or a ſin to know leſs.</hi> Job doth well reprove this ſelf-conceit, <hi>Job</hi> 12.2, 3. His friends would needs bear him down, and were very angry with him that hee was not of their minde, and would not acknowledge all to bee true of himſelf which they ſaid againſt him; hee takes them up ſharply; <hi>No doubt yee are the people, and wiſdome ſhall dye with you, but I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding as well as you, and I am not inferiour to you, who knoweth not ſuch things as theſe?</hi> Let not any man think that hee hath engroſſed all the knowledge of the world to himſelf, but others know the ſame things which hee doth, and many things better than hee.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In matters of <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Contracts,</hi> which ariſe from thence; Now a <hi>contract</hi> is <hi>a mutual transferring of right;</hi> when I buy any thing of another, hee makes over the right of ſuch a Commodity to mee for ſo much mony, or other valuable thing, the right where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I make over to him. Now in this kinde of entercourſe, wee are to bee governed by this great Rule. In <hi>making</hi> of Contracts wee muſt <hi>agere bonâ fide,</hi> deal honeſtly and truely; in <hi>performing</hi> of contracts wee muſt <hi>liberare fidem,</hi> ſatisfie the ingagement wee have made, for thus wee our ſelves would bee dealt withall.</p>
            <p>Now if any ſhall deſire to bee more particularly ſatisfied, <hi>What that exact righteouſneſs is, which in matter of Contracts, ought to bee obſerved betwixt Man and Man?</hi> I muſt confeſs this is a difficult queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to bee handled very modeſtly, by ſuch as acknowledge themſelves unacquainted with the affairs of the World, and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of things, and the particular, and hidden reaſons of ſome kinde of dealings; For hee that is ignorant of theſe, may eaſily give rules, which will not comply with the affaires of the world; hee may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of that which cannot bee otherwiſe, and blame ſome kinde of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46545:121"/> dealings which are juſtifiable, from particular reaſons, not obvious to any man, who is unſeen in the way of Trade. Beſides there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Caſes fall under this queſtion which are very nice, but of great conſequence, and the greater caution and tenderneſs ought to bee uſed in the reſolution of them, becauſe they are matters of conſtant practiſe, and the greateſt part of mankinde are concerned in them; now it is a dangerous thing; to miſtake in thoſe things, in which many perſons are intereſted, eſpecially if they bee things of ſuch a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Evil, Right,</hi> and <hi>Wrong</hi> are; For if that bee determin'd to bee lawful, which is unlawful, men are <hi>led into ſin;</hi> if that bee determin'd to bee unlawful, which is lawful, men are <hi>led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſnare,</hi> for if this determination bee to the prejudice of men in their callings, it is an hundred to one, but common example and private intereſt, will make many continue in that practiſe; and then the miſchief is this, though men do that which is lawful and right, yet they are ſtaggered by the authority and confidence of him, who hath determin'd it unlawful; and ſo have ſome reluctancy in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in the doing of it; and this by accident becomes a great ſin to them; and when upon a ſick bed, or any other occaſion, they come to bee touched with the ſenſe of ſin, this will bee matter of greater horrour and affrightment to them, than a real ſin which they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ignorantly, and were afterwards convinced of. Upon all theſe conſiderations, I ought to proceed with great warineſs, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of this queſtion, therefore I ſhall content my ſelf with ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things which are clear, and evident, though they bee but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, rather then venture out of my depth by deſcending into particulars, and ſuch things as are out of my notice.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Lay down the general <hi>Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Some <hi>propoſitions</hi> which may tend to the explication of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some ſpecial Rules, for the directing of our Commerce and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The general <hi>Rule</hi> is this; <hi>That which it is not unreaſonable for mee to deſire to gain by another, when I am to ſell, that I ſhould allow another to gain by mee, when I am to buy; and that which it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, another ſhould gain by mee, when I am to buy, that, and no more I may gain by another, when I am to ſell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>propoſitions,</hi> which I ſhall lay down, for the further expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Rule, are theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In buying and ſelling, ſuch a proportion of gain may bee taken, and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46545:121"/> ought to bee allowed, as is mutually and univerſally beſt.</hi> And this every man is preſumed to deſire, becauſe this will be certainly good for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, whereas if it be not univerſally good, it may be bad for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, if it bee not mutually ſo, it will bee bad for mee by turns.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That proportion of gain which allows a reaſonable compenſation for our time, and pains, and hazard, is univerſally and mutually beſt.</hi> If the compenſation bee unreaſonably great, it will be bad for the buyer, if unreaſonably little, it will be bad for the ſeller, if equal, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, it will be good for all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That proportion of gain, which in common intercourſe and uſe of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining among thoſe who underſtand what they buy and ſell, is generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; ought to be eſteemed a reaſonable compenſation.</hi> This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe the common reaſon of mankind doth beſt determine what is reaſonable. Therefore thoſe who ſpeak of <hi>commutative juſtice,</hi> and place it <hi>in the equality of things contracted for,</hi> need explaining, for <hi>value</hi> is not a thing <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>certain,</hi> but <hi>relative,</hi> and <hi>mutable;</hi> Now to fix the value of things as much as may be, this <hi>Rule</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly given, <hi>Tanti unumquodque valet, quanti vendi poteſt. Every thing is worth ſo much as it may bee ſold for,</hi> which muſt not be underſtood too particularly, as if the preſent and particular appetite of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor were to be the Rule, for every thing is not worth ſo much as any body will give for it, but ſo much as in common intercourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong knowing perſons it will give. For this I take for a truth, that in the ordinary plenty of commodities, there is an ordinary and uſual price of them known to the underſtanding perſons of every Profeſſion; If I be out in this, the matter of gain will be more uncertain than I thought on.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A reaſonable compenſation doth not conſiſt in an indiviſible point, but hath a certain latitude which likewiſe is to bee determined by the common intercourſe and practice of mankind.</hi> Suppoſe ten in the hundred be the uſual gain made of ſuch a commodity, eleven the higheſt, nine the loweſt, the latitude is betwixt nine and eleven.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Every man engaged in a way of commerce, is preſumed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, unleſs the contrary bee evident.</hi> So that keeping within the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a lawful gain, I may uſe my skill againſt another man in driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bargain. But if his want of skill be evident (that is) ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to mee, I muſt uſe him as I would do a childe, or other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful perſon, that is, fairly.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Where the price of things alters</hi> (as it often doth almoſt in all
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46545:122"/> things) <hi>no other Rule can bee given but the common and market-price.</hi> There are ſome things which are fixedly certain, <hi>as coyn;</hi> there I have no latitude at all; I may not put off a peece of mony for more than its value, though a perſon out of ignorance would take it for more; There are ſome commodities which in ordinary plenty being of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary goodneſs, have an uſual price; here I have but little latitude, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the market; In the riſing and falling of commodities, I have a greater latitude, but uſually in theſe caſes the Market ſets ſome kinde of price; unleſs I be the ſole Maſter of a commodity, and here the latitude is the greateſt, and my own reaſon and moderation muſt limit mee: And if any ask why I make the Market the Rule, ſeeing this ſeems to be as if I ſhould ſay, let every man get as much as hee can, for ſo men in the Market do; I anſwer, The Market is uſually more reaſonable than the particular appetites of men; and though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man be apt to get as much as hee can, yet men generally have an appetite to ſell, as well as to ſell dear, and that checks this, and men are brought to moderation, becauſe they are unwilling to loſe cuſtome; ſo that hee that governs himſelf by the Market-prizes, not catching at particular advantages, ſeems to mee to follow the ſafeſt Rule.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>There are ſome things allowed in common intercourſe, which are ſo rigorous, that they are hardly just,</hi> which are rather tollerable than commendable. I will give one inſtance inſtead of many; A man hath a ſmall peece of ground lying within another mans eſtate, hee is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſell, but requires (poſſibly) forty or ſixty years purchaſe, or more, according to the particular appetite of the purchaſer; This ſeems not to be ſo agreeable to this great Rule of equity; I deny not but ſome advantage may be made in this caſe, and I will not ſet any peremptory limits; I ſhall only ſay this in general, wee ſhould ſet a moderate va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon another mans appetite and convenience.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>It is to bee feared, that ſomething very like unrighteouſneſs is woven into the myſtery of moſt Trades.</hi> And like <hi>Phideas</hi> his image in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi>'s ſhield, cannon be defaced without the ruine of it. I think this is not a groundleſs jealouſie, but the confeſſion and complaint of the moſt knowing and underſtanding perſons in humane affair. I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only in the <hi>ſleightneſs of work,</hi> the <hi>imbaſing of commodities, and ſetting them off by indirect advantages.</hi> I can only bewail this, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the world could generally be convinced of this, it is not like to be amended. Perfection is not to be looked for in this imperfect ſtate, wee muſt be content if things are paſſable.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Nevertheleſs wee ought to aſpire after as great a degree of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46545:122"/> and Equity, as the condition of humane affairs will admit.</hi> Wee ſhould bend all our endeavours to the bettering of the world, and not only avoid all unrighteouſneſs, but draw back as much as in us lyes from the indirect practices of the world, and from all appearance of unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The more <hi>Particular Rules</hi> are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Impoſe upon no mans ignorance or unskilfulneſs.</hi> Thou mayeſt ſet a juſt value upon thine own commodity, but not a price upon another mans head; I mean, thou mayeſt not tate a mans want of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſet a tax upon his ignorance; therefore take no advantage of children, or any other incompetent perſons, and do not only uſe them with juſtice, but with ingenuity, as thoſe that repoſe a truſt in you, and caſt themſelves upon your equity. And here are ſome queſtions to be reſolved.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>If a man be otherwiſe skilful in his calling, may not I take advantage of his ignorance of a particular circumſtance wherein the contract is concerned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I will tell you how <hi>Tully</hi> reſolves this in a particular caſe;<note place="margin">De Officiis. l. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>A man</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>brings a Ship of Corn from</hi> Alexandria <hi>to</hi> Rhodes, <hi>in a time of great famine, hee may have what price hee will, hee knows of a great many more ſhips that will bee there next day, may hee conceal this from the</hi> Rhodians? Hee determines peremptorily hee may not. If wee will be worſe than Heathens — I ſay no more.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>But may wee not take advantage of the ignorance of the ſeller, though not of the buyer?</hi> the difference is, hee that offers to ſell any thing at ſuch a price, is willing ſo to part with it; Now <hi>there is no wrong done to him that is willing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>A man is ſo far willing, as hee is knowing; Aristotle</hi> tells us, <hi>That Ignorance is a ſort of unwillingneſs,</hi> If a man out of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, or want of conſideration, or ſufficient underſtanding of his own calling miſtake himſelf, I may not make a prize of this mans weakneſs; for hee is only willing to ſell it ſo upon ſuppoſition, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members right, and underſtands himſelf aright, but the thing being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally worth more, hee is abſolutely unwilling, and I am injurious to him in taking advantage.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>May I not ſell ſecret faults and vices in a commodity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               </label> 
               <hi>Let us not revenge our ſelves;</hi> The rule is not, wee ſhould do to others as they do to us, but as wee would have them to do to us; as if it were on purpoſe to prevent revenge. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> forbids revenge from this rule; <hi>Luke</hi> 6.31, 32. For if you love them that love you &amp;c. But love your enemies. Revenge is the greateſt offence againſt this rule, for hee that revengeth an injury, hath received one, hee that hath received one, knows beſt what that is, which hee would not have another to do to him; the nature of evil and injury is better
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46545:124"/> known to the patient, than to the agent, men know better what they ſuffer, than what they do, hee that is injur'd feels it and knows how greivous it is, and will hee do that to another?</p>

               <label>2. <hi>Uſe,</hi>
               </label> Let mee preſs this rule upon you; Live by it, in all your carriage and dealings with men, let it bee preſent to you. Aske your ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every occaſion, would I that another ſhould deal thus with mee, and carry himſelf thus towards mee? But I ſhall preſs this chiefly, as to juſtice and righteouſneſs in our Commerce. It is ſaid that <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour cauſed this Rule to bee written upon his palace,<note place="margin">Lampridius.</note> and in all publick places; let it bee writ upon our houſes, and ſhops, and exchanges. This exhortation is not altogether improper for this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory; you that frequent theſe exerciſes ſeem to have a good ſenſe of that part of Religion, which is contain'd in the firſt Table; do not by your violations of the ſecond, marre your obedience to the firſt; do not prove your ſelves Hypocrites in the firſt Table, by being wicked in the ſecond; give not the World juſt cauſe to ſay, that you are ungodly becauſe they finde you to bee unrighteous; but manifeſt your love to God, whom you have not ſeen, by your love to your Brother whom you have ſeen; and if any man wrong his Brother, hee cannot love him. Do not reject or deſpiſe this exhortaton, under the contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name of <hi>Morality.</hi> Our Saviour tells us, this is a cheif part of that which hath ever been accounted Religion in the World, <hi>It is the Law and the Prophets;</hi> and hee by injoyning it hath adopted it into Chriſtianity, and made it Goſpel. Wee ſhould have an eſpecial love to this precept, not only as it is the dictate of nature, and the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> not only as it is a Jewiſh, and Gentile principle, but as it is of the <hi>houſehold of Faith.</hi> When the young man told Chriſt, that <hi>hee had kept the Commandements from his youth,</hi> it is ſaid <hi>Jeſus loved him;</hi>

               <hi>and though the former uſually gives us the Title, the latter is the ſurer; for true profeſſion without an honeſt converſation, not only ſaves not, but increaſeth our weight of puniſhment; but a good life without true profeſſion though it brings us not to Heaven, yet it leſſens the meaſure of our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that a moral man ſo call'd is a Chriſtian by the ſurer ſide.</hi> And afterwards, <hi>I confeſs</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I have not yet made that proficiency in the ſchooles of our age, as that I could ſee why the ſecond Table, and the Acts of it are not as properly the parts of Religion and Chriſtianity, as the Acts and obſervations of the firſt; if I miſtake, then it is St.</hi> James <hi>that hath abuſed mee, for hee deſcribing Religion by it</hi>'s <hi>proper Acts tells us, that pure Religion, and undefiled before God, and the Father is this, to viſit the Fatherleſs and the Widdow in their affliction, and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the World; ſo that that thing which in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial refined dialect of the new Chriſtian Language, ſignifies nothing but morality and civility, that in the language of the Holy Ghoſt imports true Religion.</hi> Mark. 12.33, 34. when the Scribe told Chriſt that <hi>to love God with all the heart, &amp;c. And our neighbours as our ſelves, was more than whole burnt offerings and ſacrifices;</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>when Jeſus ſaw that hee anſwered diſcreetly, hee ſaid unto him thou art not far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi> They that would have a Religion without moral righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, talk <hi>indiſcreetly,</hi> and are further from the Kingdome of God than a meer moral man. If wee neglect this part of Religion wee diſparage the Goſpel, and abuſe our profeſſion, wee are but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Chriſtianity. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaks ſomewhere to this purpoſe, hee had rather poſterity ſhould ſay, there was never ſuch a man as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> than that hee was a vicious, or cruel, or unjuſt man.</p>
            <pb n="268" facs="tcp:46545:125"/>
            <p>I had rather a man ſhould not call himſelf a Chriſtian, that hee ſhould renounce his Title, than that by his life and actions, hee ſhould repreſent Chriſtians to the world, as oppreſſors, as unjuſt, and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous dealers. If men will only uſe Religion for to cover their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, I had rather they would put off their Cloaks, and bee Knaves <hi>in querpo,</hi> that every body may know them, than that they ſhould go like High-way-men in vizards, and diſguiſes, only that they may rob honeſt men the more ſecurely.</p>
            <p>And to move you to the practice of this Rule, I ſhall only offer to you one Conſideration, but which hath ſo much weight in it, that it may be inſtead of many; <hi>As you deal with others, ſo yee ſhall bee dealt with.</hi> With what meaſure you mere to others, it ſhall be meaſured to you, is a proverbial ſpeech often uſed by our Saviour, and which one time or other you will finde to be very ſignificant. God doth many times by his providence order things ſo, that in this life mens unrighteouſneſs returns upon their own heads and their violent dealing upon their own pates; There is a divine <hi>Nemeſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> which brings our iniquities upon our ſelves. No man hath any vice or humour alone, but it may be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world, either in its own kind, or in another; if a man be cruel and inſolent, <hi>A Bajazet ſhall meet with a Tamerlane;</hi> if a man delight to jeer and abuſe others, <hi>no man hath ſo good a wit, but another hath as good a memory;</hi> hee will remember it to revenge it; Hee that makes a trade of deceiving and couzening others, hee doth but teach others to couzen him; and there are but few Maſters in any kinde but are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by ſome of their Schollars. But however wee may eſcape the hands of men, how ſhall wee eſcape our own conſciences, either trouble of conſcience in this life, or the worm of conſcience in the next? how ſhall wee eſcape the hands of the Living God? how ſhall wee eſcape the damnation of Hell? 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Let no man go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, or defraud his Brother in any matter, for God is the avenger of all ſuch.</hi> Hee will take their cauſe into his own hands, and render to us according to our fraudulent and cruel dealing with others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.35. <hi>So likewiſe ſhall my Heavenly Father do alſo unto you, &amp;c.</hi> What our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29.

               <hi>Riches are not for ever,</hi> they cannot be carried out of this world.<note place="margin">Job 1.21.</note> 
               <hi>As naked wee came into this world, ſo naked ſhall wee go out of it.</hi> And therefore it muſt needs be a point of great wiſdome by that which is but for this preſent world, to ſtore up a ſure foundation for the time to come.</p>
            <p>In the next place follows the Vices here forbidden, the firſt is, <hi>High-mindedneſs,</hi> whereunto rich men are very prone, in that their wealth is as wind; and though wind be but a vapour yet it puffeth up exceedingly, as wee ſee in a bladder blown up with wind. In like manner,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.2.</note> Riches, though they be but <hi>meer vanity,</hi> as the Wiſe-man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, yet are they apt to puff up men extreamly, even to think of themſelves above what is meet. Whereas if rich men would but well weigh, that they came from, and muſt return to the ſame mould that others do;<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>for duſt they are, and to duſt they muſt return;</hi> Yea if they would conſider that they came from the ſame curſed ſtock that others do, and are by nature no better than the meaneſt; eſpecially if they would conſider, that outward riches cannot add the leaſt dram of real worth to the owners of them; but though they may be the more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable parts or members in the civil body of the ſtate, yet in the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body of Chriſt they may be leſs honourable than the poor; I ſay, if rich men did but ſeriouſly conſider theſe things, they would not bee ſo high-minded as they are.</p>
            <p>The other Vice here forbidden unto rich men, is, <hi>Vain-confidence,</hi> or <hi>truſting in their riches;</hi> and this is very fitly joyned to the former; for where our pride is, there will bee our confidence. That rich men are apt to put too much truſt and confidence in their riches, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46545:127"/> by the titles which they commonly give unto them, calling them <hi>their goods,</hi> as if they were the only good things; and <hi>their ſubſtance,</hi> as if all things elſe were ſhadows; and by the increaſe of them they ſay they are made for ever, and by the loſs of them, they ſay they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly undone. What do theſe expreſſions imply, but a truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their Riches; Whereupon ſaith the Wiſe-man,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.11.</note> 
               <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong City, and as an high wall in his own conceit.</hi> It makes him think himſelf ſo ſafe and ſecure, that like the Judge men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by our Saviour, <hi>hee feareth not God, nor regardeth man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 18.2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place follows the Vertues enjoyned.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Confidence, or Faith in God,</hi> which is directly oppoſed to truſt in Riches, ſo as rich men may have wherein to truſt, though they truſt not in riches. God is the God of the Rich, as well as of the Poor, and the one as well as the other, are to put their whole truſt in him.</p>
            <p>And if wee conſider the property here given to God, <hi>viz. Living, but truſt in the Living God;</hi> wee ſhall ſee good reaſon to truſt in God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in Riches. For our wealth may vaniſh away, but hee ever liveth, our wealth may prove our bane, but he is both the giver and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of life. Our truſting in God is here preſſed by an Argument taken from Gods bounty to us in theſe words, <hi>who giveth us richly all things to enjoy:</hi> So that the Lord is not only a <hi>Living,</hi> but alſo a <hi>Giving</hi> God, of whoſe gift you have not only your life; but alſo your riches; yea all that you have is the gift of God, who giveth you not onely all needful things, but alſo <hi>richly,</hi> and as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>liberally.</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 1.6.</note> For God in his gifts ſheweth himſelf to be a God, and that two waies. 1. In the freeneſs. 2. In the greatneſs of them.<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.19.</note> 
               <hi>Hee loadeth us with benefits,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt.</hi> This rich bounty of God is a further Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to draw you to truſt in him.</p>
            <p>Yea the Apoſtle addeth, that the Lord giveth us all things richly <hi>to enjoy;</hi> that is, not only for the preſent to ſpend, as being abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; but alſo to lay up and reſerve, ſo as it is not unlawful to lay up for aftertimes. The Apoſtle preſſeth it on Parents as a bounden duty,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.14.</note> 
               <hi>to lay up for their children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only let this lawful liberty be limited with theſe &amp; ſuch like bounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That wee lay up nothing but what is juſtly gotten. To lay up riches of unrighteouſneſs, is to kindle a fire that may deſtroy both our temporal and our ſpiritual eſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That wee be not ſo covetous of hoarding up, as to deny our ſelves what is needful for our uſe and comfort, or to deny the poor what is needful and neceſſary for them; but that wee willingly give out as
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46545:128"/> what is meet for our ſelves, ſo what is needful to the poor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That in our treaſuring up wee aim not meerly, wholly, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at our ſelves, but withall have an eye as to the charge which in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular God hath committed to us, ſo alſo to the Church, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and Poor for the time to come.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That wee exceed not meaſure in our treaſure, no though we aim at the fore-mentioned good ends.</p>
            <p>So much for the clearing the firſt duty the Apoſtle would have preſſed upon rich men eſpecially, which is to <hi>Truſt in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is <hi>Charity towards men,</hi> expreſſed in ſeveral phraſes, as firſt <hi>by doing good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they do good.</hi> So that true Charity conſiſteth not onely in compaſſionate affections, and kind ſpeeches,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> but in good deeds, as the word in the Original implieth.</p>
            <p>You rich men ought <hi>to bee rich in good works,</hi> as the Apoſtle addeth. For God expecteth fruit anſwerable to the ſeed which hee ſoweth. Hee giveth you plenty of ſeed, therefore you muſt be plentiful in this kind of fruit.</p>
            <p>The next branches, <hi>Ready to diſtribute, willing to Communicate,</hi> ſet forth the manner of our charity.</p>
            <p>The former implying <hi>a wiſe distribution of our Alms;</hi> for <hi>to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute</hi> is not hand over head without conſideration to give, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the need of them to whom wee give. The latter implying a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs therein. As, by diſtributing, good is done to others, ſo by willingneſs therein, much comfort is brought to our own ſouls, and grace to the work;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.7.</note> And God doth beſt accept ſuch, for <hi>hee loveth a chearfull, willing giver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place follows the Reaſons, to enforce the fore-named duties, taken from the benefit of performing them, which is in brief, aſſurance of eternal life, implied in theſe words, <hi>Laying up in ſtore for themſelves, a good foundation, againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</hi> The Apoſtle here, for their better encouragement to lay out a portion of their eſtate on good works telleth them that they are ſo far from looſing what they ſo lay out, as in truth <hi>they lay up thereby in ſtore for themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, they lay up a good foundation,</hi> that is ſuch a treaſure as is like a foundation in the ground, that cannot bee ſhaken nor over-thrown. This treaſure the Apoſtle thus expreſſeth, in oppoſition to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned uncertainty of riches. So as by a cheerfull diſtribution of this worlds wealth, they do indeed but exchange uncertainties, for
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46545:128"/> certainties, and ſo no fear of looſing by ſuch bargains. Yea, <hi>they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obtain eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are then good works the cauſe of eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Surely No, only they are the means and way of attaining thereto, and in this ſenſe, is this phraſe here uſed; <hi>That they may lay hold on eternal life:</hi> Having thus ſhewed you the <hi>occaſion</hi> of the words; the <hi>logical reſolution</hi> of them; their <hi>ſenſe and meaning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould now according to my accuſtomed method, come to ſuch points of Doctrine, which the words do naturally afford unto us; But I muſt wave them, and fall upon that <hi>Queſtion,</hi> or <hi>caſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which was given mee to handle; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How, or after what manner, must wee give Alms, that they may bee acceptable, and pleaſing unto God?</hi> In the reſolving whereof, I ſhall endeavour to anſwer moſt of the caſes of conſcience about alms-giving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It muſt bee <hi>with juſtice,</hi> giving only of our own, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto wee have a juſt right &amp; title, ſo much our Saviour implieth in that precept of his, where hee ſaith, <hi>Give Alms of ſuch things as you have,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 11.41.</note> whereby is not meant, ſuch things as a man hath by him (for one may have another mans things by him) but ſuch things as are his own, whereunto hee hath a juſt title, an undoubted right, whereof hee is the lawful proprietor, hath the power of diſpoſing thoſe things, and thoſe only hee may lawfully and juſtly give away,</p>
            <p>This Caveat is very neceſſary for many Reaſons,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe otherwiſe we ſhall ſever mercy from juſtice, which ſhould alwaies go hand in hand; God hath put them together; <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.21. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. &amp; we muſt not put them aſunder; indeed they are two links of one &amp; the ſame chain, of which other vertues and graces are alſo other links; So many vertues, ſo many links; Now if one link of a chain fall off, the whole chain is broken, and down falls that which is drawn or held up by it; ſo wee that are held out of the pit of deſtruction by the Chains of graces, are in danger to fall into it, if one grace bee violated, and ſevered from the reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By giving that which is not our own,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.21.</note> the excellency and glory of Charity is loſt, of ſuch charity it may bee ſaid <hi>Ichabod,</hi> where is the glory? The glory of Charity conſiſts in this, that wee are willing to part with our own, and therein to damnifie our ſelves, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and ſuccour of others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By giving that which is not our own, wee do wrong, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make our ſelves liable to reſtitution. So as Charity in ſuch a caſe,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46545:129"/> is a plain injury. It is a caſe wherin recompence of revenge may more be feared, than recompence of reward expected.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Who may bee ſaid to give that, which is not their own?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. They who filch, ſteal, or rob for this very end,</hi> As Parents for Children, or Children for Parents, or one friend for another. It is a ſin for one to ſteal to ſatisfie his own hunger,<note place="margin">Prov. 6.31.</note> Much more it is ſin, to ſteal for another, certainly it is a great wickedneſs to do injuſtice that wee may do acts of Charity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such as having raiſed up an estate, or got ſomething by indirect and unjuſt means, as by lying, ſwearing, falſe weigh's, deceitful mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the like; think to make up all by giving part to the Poor?</hi> For as the <hi>Civilians</hi> ſay well,<note place="margin">Bonus uſus non juſtificat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justè quaeſita.</note> 
               <hi>the good uſe doth not juſtifie, the unjuſt get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their goods.</hi> And can any imagine that God will bee pleaſed with thoſe mens charity, who give relief out of that which they have wrongfully gotten? reſtitution ſhould rather bee made to ſuch as have been wronged. And if neither the parties wronged; nor their heirs can bee found, then what hath been wrongfully got, ought to bee given to the Poor, as their heirs. An example whereof wee have in <hi>Zacheus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 19.8.</note> who having wronged many by oppreſſion, after his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, offereth fourfold reſtitution unto all whom hee had wronged, and becauſe many could not be found, to whom hee ſhould make it, hee offereth to beſtow half of his goods to the relief of the Poor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Such as being under authority, and have no propriety in the things which they give, do notwithſtanding give, directly againſt, or ſimply without the conſent of thoſe who have the true propriety, do not give of their own,</hi> as Servants, Children and others. Indeed Servants, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, may lawfully give out of that which is their own, but not out of that which is their Maſters, or Parents, without their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Such as being joyned in partnerſhip with another, and give Alms out of the Common stock without the conſent of their Partners, do not give that which is their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Such as are in extream debt, and owe more than they are worth;</hi> Wee ſhewed that mercy and juſtice muſt go together, yea, juſtice muſt go before mercy, and bee ſatisfied before mercy bee ſhewed. They who owe more than they are worth, have nothing at all to give for Alms, ſuch joyne Arrogancy to Injuſtice, to make ſhew of a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and yet have none.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe this with a word of advice to ſuch as have a merciful and charitable diſpoſition, above their outward condition and ability;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:46545:129"/> That they uſe the beſt diligence they can, by all lawful and warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means, to get ſomething to beſtow upon charitable uſes. Let poor labouring men take ſo much the more pains, that they may have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to give; let ſervants ſpare out of their wages;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.20.</note> let ſuch as have no propriety in any thing, but are wholly maintained by them under whom they live, as Children, apprentices, and others, do what they can to obtain ſomething of their Parents, or other governours, even for this very end, that they may have ſomething to give. Let ſuch as are in debt, firſt pay their debts, and then give Alms. Let ſuch as have any way defrauded others, firſt make reſtitution, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them that are in need. Finally, let ſuch as live at the extent of their eſtate, and much more, ſuch as live beyond their means, well weigh wherein they may cut off ſome of their expences to beſtow on the Poor.</p>
            <p n="2">II Alms-giving muſt bee <hi>with freedome, and cheerfulneſs,</hi> and not grudgingly; The phraſe of <hi>giving Alms,</hi> frequently mentioned in Scripture implieth as much, for to give, is freely to beſtow. In the Law this propriety of <hi>giving,</hi> is plainly expreſſed, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thus explained, <hi>Thou ſhalt freely give him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 15.10.</note> 
               <hi>and thine heart ſhall not bee greived when thou giveſt unto him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 15.11.</note> It is alſo implyed under this phraſe, <hi>thou ſhalt open thy hand wide,</hi> Almes muſt not bee wreſted and wrung out of a mans hand, but hee muſt of himſelf <hi>open his hand,</hi> that is, freely give. The word <hi>wide</hi> addeth emphaſis. And in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, wee finde it commanded by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 Cor 9.7.</note> 
               <hi>Every man according as hee purpoſeth in his heart, ſo let him give, not grudgingly, or of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, for God loveth a cheerful giver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many motives may bee produced to induce us hereunto: as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The pattern of God our Heavenly Father, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, our Redeemer.</hi>

            <p>This Reaſon of Gods love, <hi>the Lord ſet his love upon you, becauſe hee loved you,</hi> doth clearly demonſtrate the freeneſs of it.</p>
            <p>The good alſo which the Son of God, Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour doth for us, hee doth moſt freely upon his own love, without any deſert of ours: in this reſpect it is ſaid that hee hath <hi>loved us,</hi>

               <hi>Though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and have not charity, it profiteth mee nothing.</hi> By <hi>Charity</hi> hee meaneth a free giving of that which is given, meerly out of love and pitty to him, unto whom hee giveth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Free giving makes that which is given to man acceptable to God; for <hi>God loveth a chearful giver.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.7.</note> Yea God hath more reſpect to this matter of giving, than to the greatneſs of the gift. <hi>For if there be firſt a willing mind,</hi>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Daies of Thankſgiving</hi> for ſome eminent mercy, are another ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time of doing works of mercy. The remembring of the poor at ſuch times is expreſly commanded in Scripture;<note place="margin">Deut. 16.14.</note>

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Daies of faſting and prayer,</hi> are another ſeaſonable time of doing works of mercy. For how can wee expect that God ſhould ſhew mercy unto us in removing thoſe Judgements which wee feel, or in preventing thoſe which wee fear; if wee will not ſhew mercy to our poor Brethren, who ſtand in need of our relief? In the day of our faſting therefore, let us at leaſt give away to the poor ſo much as wee ſave by our faſt. For as <hi>Auſtin</hi> in one of his Sermons ſaith, <hi>Then are our faſts acceptable to God,</hi>

               <hi>if they which fast out of neceſſity, becauſe they want meat, bee relieved by us.</hi> Let this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be alwaies obſerved by us, that the poor have the gain of our faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not our own purſes.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Our Alms muſt be given <hi>readily and ſpeedily,</hi> without any needleſs delay; according to the counſel of the Wiſe-man,<note place="margin">Prov. 3.27.</note> 
               <hi>With-hold not good from them, to whom it is due;</hi> that is, with-hold not any act of Charity from thoſe who ſtand in need of thy help, <hi>Say not unto thy Neighbour, go and come again, and to morrow I will give thee, when thou

            <p>I ſhall deſire ſuch ſeriouſly to conſider, theſe ſix things;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That if all rich men ſhould do thus, the poor would ſoon bee ſtarved for want of bread.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3 That they have no aſſurance of the continuance of their wealth. For as the wiſeman ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Prov. 23.5. <hi>Alas Aquilinas.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Riches many times make themſelves wings, they fly away as an Eagle towards Heaven;</hi> they have <hi>Eagles wings</hi> to fly from us. And how many are there, who have out-lived a fair e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate? If God in his diſpleaſure, blaſts a mans ſubſtance; it vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away in a moment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though their riches ſhould continue with them, even to their deaths, yet they have no aſſurance that God will give them grace to bee liberal at their deaths, who had never the goodneſs to bee chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in their life-time.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That they have no aſſurance that God will accept of their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed charity: what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaketh of death-bed repentance, that <hi>it is ſeldome true and hearty;</hi> The ſame may I ſay of death-bed charity, it is ſeldome true and hearty, but for the moſt part rotten and Hypocritical, proceeding from ill grounds, as vain-glory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of merit, and the like.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That they have no aſſurance of the true performance of their will, that the poor ſhall bee the better for what is thereby given them. For how many <hi>Exeoutours</hi> have proved moſt unfaithful to their truſts, whereby many charitable gifts have been clean perverted. And if friends bee ſo unfaithful, to us in our life time; how can wee but
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46545:132"/> queſtion their fidelity after our deaths? Oh therefore that all, whom the Lord hath bleſſed with an eſtate, would in their life time become their <hi>own adminiſtrators,</hi> making (as one ſaith) their <hi>own hands</hi> their <hi>Executors,</hi> and their <hi>own eyes</hi> their <hi>Overſeers.</hi> For queſtionleſs that charity which is exerciſed in a mans life time is the beſt, and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Our Alms muſt bee <hi>bountiful,</hi> and <hi>liberal,</hi> giving out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to what the Lord hath given unto us. This is implied in that command of God to his people,<note place="margin">Deut. 15.11.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt open thine hand wide unto thy Brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy in the Land;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt give unto him bountifully and liberally. And our Apoſtle here in the Text, would have rich men charged <hi>to bee rich in good work,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.18. Luke 12.48.</note> 
               <hi>even as God hath given them all things richly to enjoy; For unto whomſoever much is given, of him much ſhall bee required.</hi> And therefore the ſame Apoſtle adviſeth the Corinthians to <hi>give;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.2.</note> 
               <hi>as God had proſpered them:</hi> To whom God hath given little of this worlds goods, of them hee requireth but little, but to whom hee hath given much, of them hee requireth much.

            <p>Queſt. <hi>If any ſhall aske what is that portion, or proportion of estate, which rich men ought to ſet apart for Charitable uſes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is an hard matter to determine the quantity and proportion of mens charity, the ſcripture being ſilent herein, leaving this to the diſcretion &amp; ingenuity of the prudent Chriſtian.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.7.</note> As the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>every man according as hee purpoſeth in his heart, ſo let him g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But yet though the Scripture giveth us no direct <hi>precept</hi> in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; it holdeth forth many <hi>preſidents</hi> for our imitation; as that of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who in teſtimony of his thankfulneſs unto God for what hee ſhould beſtow upon him, Vowed the tenth part thereof unto God for Pious and Charitable uſes. <hi>And Jacob vowed a vow unto God ſaying,</hi>

               <hi>of all that thou ſhalt give mee, I will ſurely give the tenth unto thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 10.20. 2 Cor. 8.3.</note> Of <hi>Cornelius</hi> it is recorded, that <hi>hee gave much Alms.</hi> And the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> are highly commended, for their great bounty, and large contributions.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.4. 1 Cor. 10.11.</note> Theſe examples are left upon record for our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>By laying out a portion of their eſtate in ſuch a way as directly tends to the worſhip of God, the advancement of Religion, the ſalvation of mens ſouls;</hi> which I may not unfitly term, <hi>A Spiritual Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this may alſo be done ſeveral waies. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By contributing towards the planting and propagating the Goſpel where it hath not been.</hi> A work ſet on foot by divers in <hi>New England,</hi> but chiefly carried on by the charity of well-diſpoſed people here in <hi>Old England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By ſetting up, and maintaining of Lectures;</hi> the preaching of the Word,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.16.</note> being the ordinary means appointed by God for the bringing of ſinners to the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>whom to know is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By adding to the maintenance of ſuch ſettled Preachers, whoſe pains are great, and means ſmall,</hi> through the covetouſneſs of Impropriators, who ingroſs to themſelves what doth more properly belong to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>By maintaining of poor Schollars at the Univerſity in reference to the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46545:133"/> work of the Miniſtery,</hi> that ſo there may be a continual ſupply of learned, godly, and Orthodox Miniſters, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>By beſtowing of Bibles on poor Children,</hi> whereby through the care of their Parents,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.</note> they may be acquainted <hi>with the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, which are able to make them wiſe unto ſalvation.</hi> Memorable is the pious gift of Sir <hi>John Fenner,</hi> who by his laſt will gave ſix pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to ſeveral out-Pariſhes in <hi>London</hi> for the buying of Bibles to be diſtributed amongſt poor children. From my own experience I can ſay, that this gift hath occaſioned many poor people to teach their children to read, that ſo they might be capable of thoſe Bibles, which are to be given only to ſuch as can in ſome meaſure read.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>By erecting of Country-Schools,</hi> and endowing them with ſome competent maintenance, for teaching of poor mens children, who have not wherewithall to pay for their ſchooling; which will be a ſpecial means not only to further their civil, but likewiſe their ſpiritual edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For thereby they will bee made more capable of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Experience teacheth us how ineffectual the moſt powerful Miniſtry is upon an ignorant and unlearned Congregation.<note place="margin">Docere ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſt melius quam paſcere. Aquin. <hi>2. 2.</hi> Quaest. <hi>32.</hi>
               </note> Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs therefore the erecting of Country-ſchools is a work of charity, more noble in it ſelf, more acceptable to God, and more beneficial to the Kingdome, than the building of Alms-houſes, who are too often filled with ſwarms of idle drones. But though this <hi>Spiritual Charity</hi> is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs the more excellent, as tending to a more excellent object, namely, the ſouls of our neighbours, yet the bodies of our neighbours muſt be cared for, as well as their ſouls: Our Charity therefore muſt alſo extend to them, and in this kinde it may be practiſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>By a free and liberal giving to the relief of thoſe who are in want,</hi> of which I have already largely ſpoken.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>By a ready lending to ſuch, as being in a Calling, want stock, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means to help themſelves in their Trades.</hi> This duty of <hi>lending</hi> wee finde expreſly <hi>commanded both in the Law,</hi> and <hi>in the Goſpel;</hi> in the Law, as in the place before quoted;<note place="margin">Deut. 15.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt open thine hand wide to thy poor Brother, and ſhalt ſurely lend him ſufficient for his need in that which hee wanteth, &amp;c.</hi> In the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 6.35.</note> 
               <hi>Lend</hi> (ſaith our Saviour <hi>Looking for nothing again;</hi> that is, lend not only to ſuch from whom you may hope by reaſon of their ability to receive your own again; but alſo to ſuch, as by reaſon of their poverty may perhaps never be able to repay you.<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.26.</note> The Pſalmiſt maketh this a note of a <hi>righteous and a good man,</hi> that <hi>hee is ever merciful and lendeth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 112.5.</note> 
               <hi>that hee ſheweth favour
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46545:134"/> and lendeth.</hi> Where we ſee it is ſet down, as the property of ſuch a man, that hee is ready to lend to the poor, to ſuch as ſtand in need of his help, and that freely without hope of gain.</p>
            <p>This duty belongeth eſpecially to rich men, becauſe the occaſions of him that would borrow, uſually require more than meaner perſons can well ſpare, they can better give a penny, than lend a pound; though in many caſes the lending our Brother a conſiderable ſum to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; would be more beneficial to him, than it may be to give him half as much; there is therefore a noble and very generous act of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to be exerciſed this way, and it is peculiar to rich men, who have it by them wherewithall to do it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Rich men may and ought to expreſs their charity, <hi>by forgiving a debt, in caſe the borrower be not able to repay it</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be many who by the help of that which is lent them, God bleſſing their pains in the imployment thereof, are able to repay what is lent. If there were not hope thereof, men would rather give than lend to ſuch.</p>
            <p>But there are others, who, notwithſtanding their care and pains in their Calling, thrive not; or by ſome accident ſuffer ſuch loſs and dammage, as they are not able to repay what they have borrowed. In ſuch caſes Creditors are bound to forgive (at leaſt to forbear) their debtors.<note place="margin">Luk. 6.35.</note> This is the intendment of that charge, <hi>Lend hoping for nothing again.</hi> To take this phraſe ſimply, is to alter the nature of lending, and to turn it into giving. Herein lieth the difference betwixt <hi>lending</hi> and <hi>giving. Lending</hi> is on condition to have again that which is lent, or at leaſt the worth of it ſome other way: <hi>Giving</hi> is free, without any ſuch condition. That advice of Chriſt, to <hi>lend hoping for nothing again,</hi> hath reſpect to the mind of the lender, that hee ſhould not have his mind wholly and only upon the repaying of what hee lendeth; but on the need of his Brother. Hee is not ſimply to lend, becauſe hee is perſwaded hee ſhall loſe nothing, but have his own again. Hee is to lend, becauſe hee doth therein great kindneſs to his Brother, who ſtands in much need thereof.</p>

            <p>If therefore it ſo fall out, that the debtor be not able to repay what hee borrowed, forgive it him. Hee lends hoping for nothing again, who is willing to forgive, in caſe the neceſſity of the borrower requite
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46545:134"/> it. This was it which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> enjoyned the rich Jews.<note place="margin">Neh. 5.11.</note> Excellently doth our Lord preſs this duty in the Parable of the two Creditors; where wee have a commendable pattern of a certain King, that in ſuch a caſe forgave a great debt; and of the ſore revenge hee executed on one of his ſervants,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.23.</note> becauſe hee did not in like manner forgive his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervants.</p>
            <p>In the Old Teſtament it is commended to us under the phraſe <hi>of reſtoring the pledge.</hi>

            </p>

            <p>There are ſome allega ions made for relieving ſuch; but they are undue allegations, and may eaſily be anſwered; The chiefeſt of them is this.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Luk. 6.30.</note>1. Chriſt commandeth to <hi>give to every man that asketh thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this I anſwer, that that Precept is to be taken in reference to a falſe Poſition of the Phariſees, which was this, that their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46545:137"/> and friends only were their neighbours, whom by the Law they were bound to love. That this was their opinion, is evident by this their gloſs on the Law; <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.43.</note> 
               <hi>and hate thine enemy.</hi> And by the Parable which Chriſt produceth to demonſtrate to the Lawyer, who was his neighbour. In oppoſition to that falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Chriſt commands <hi>to give,</hi> not to friends only, but <hi>to every man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 10.29, 30, &amp;c.</note> So as the ſcope of that precept is, to take away reſpect of perſons in Alms-giving: that wee ſhould not reſtrain this duty of Charity to Country men, kindred, and friends; but extend it alſo to ſtrangers, enemies, and to every one, that being in need, crave it of us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Allegation is, <hi>That many beggars may periſh if they be not relieved.</hi>

            <p>I have done with the <hi>Queſtion</hi> allotted to mee, give mee leave to add a few words for the more profitable preſſing this moſt neceſſary, but much neglected duty of Charity; I ſhall diſpatch my intendment herein,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By ſhewing you by what means you may obtain this Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Giving you ſome Motives to quicken you up to a conſcionable performance of the works of it.</p>
            <p>The means are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Meditation,</hi> ſeriouſly meditate</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of it, which ariſeth from the Lords expreſs charge and command, unto which wee are bound to yeeld obedience. It is often commanded both in the Old and New Teſtament. That I may not be tedious, I ſhall give you but two or three proofs, <hi>Deu.</hi> 15.11. A place I often mentioned for the excellency, and exceeding pertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it to this purpoſe. Saith the Lord to his people there; <hi>The poor ſhall never ceaſe out of the Land; Therefore I command thee, ſaying, thou ſhalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy in the Land;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt give unto him freely and bountifully. And ſaith our Saviour in the New Teſtament; <hi>Give to him that asketh thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 5.42.</note> 
               <hi>and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away.</hi> And ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>To do good, and to communicate forget not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.16.</note> 
               <hi>for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well-pleaſed;</hi> in which words hee preſſeth the duty
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46545:138"/> with a forcible Motive; for who would not do that which is well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God, who is bountiful in rewarding the leaſt good wee do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his command.</p>
            <p>This duty of Alms-giving being ſo expreſſely commanded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is not in our power to omit or neglect the ſame; neither can any creature give us a diſpenſation againſt the Creators command. A Prophet ſtileth omiſſion of that which God enjoyneth to be done (yea though that omiſſion were but in part, and that upon a fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.23.</note> 
               <hi>which is as the ſin of witchcraft, and ſtubbornneſs, which is as iniquity, and idolatry.</hi> Againſt him who failed in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charge enjoyned him (though hee were a King) this doom is denounced, <hi>becauſe thou hast rejected the Word of the Lord, hee hath alſo rejected thee from being King.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.26.</note> In like manner may God reject ſuch as neglect this duty of <hi>Charity,</hi> when hee calls them to it, from being Kings, and reigning in Heaven. Wee have a manifeſt inſtance thereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41, 42, 43.</p>
            <p>Now the giving of Alms being a duty ſo expreſly commanded in the holy Scriptures, it cannot therefore be accounted a matter meerly arbitrary, left to a mans own will, to give or not to give. But it is a bounden duty, which they that in any competent meaſure can do, muſt not omit, which conſideration cannot but be a ſtrong incitation unto us, to make conſcience of this duty of Alms-giving, as occaſion is offered, and not to over-ſlip opportunities, that by the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are offered unto us. Should wee neglect that which our Lord hath expreſly commanded? that whereunto by vertue of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand wee are bound? that whereof wee are to give an account? Let us upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Lords commands do what in this kinde wee can: And when wee have done what wee can ſay,<note place="margin">Luk. 17.10.</note> 
               <hi>Wee are unprofitable ſervants, wee have done what was our duty to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>Equity</hi> of this duty of Alms-giving. It is a moſt equal thing, that hee who hath wherewithall, ſhould give to him that hath not. The equity ariſeth both from the divine providence, and alſo from the inſtability of mans ſtate and condition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God for this end gives more to ſome than to others, that they who have more abundance, ſhould give out of their abundance to them who are in want. This was typically ſignified by the gathering of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which though it were rained down from Heaven, yet the Lord would not allow, that they who had gathered much, even more than was needful for themſelves, and their houſhold, ſhould hoard up their ſuperfluity, but enjoyned them to communicate of their abundance, to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46545:138"/> ſuch as had not enough.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.14.</note> The which the Apoſtle applieth to the giving of Alms out of our abundance to thoſe who want, which hee ſtileth <hi>equality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Mans ſtate is ſo variable, as hee who now hath, may quickly want; and in want deſire to be ſuccoured by ſuch as have. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon moſt equal, that they who would be ſuccoured in their need, ſhould bee willing to ſuccour the need of others. This equity doth Chriſt himſelf preſs;<note place="margin">Matth. 7.12.</note> 
               <hi>all things whatſoever yee would that men ſhould do to you, do yee even ſo to them.</hi> And as a ground to enforce this the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he addeth, <hi>for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Hereby imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this doctrine is contained in the Law and the Prophets; but that is not all, theſe words, <hi>this is the Law and the Prophets,</hi> intend that the ſum of the law and the prophets conſiſteth therein; and the main ſcope of them tendeth thereunto; namely ſo far as they contain the duties of man to man. So evident is the equity hereof even by the light of nature, as the very heathen who wanted the light of Gods word, diſcerned it. Well therefore might the Apoſtle enforce this duty of charity upon this ground thus, <hi>Remember them that are in bonds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.3.</note> 
               <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bound with them,</hi> that is, bee helpful to others which cannot help themſelves, as you would have others afford ſuccour unto you, if you were ſuccourleſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Meditate of the manifold ſingular benefits which do follow and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a conſcionable performance of this duty;</hi> For thereby wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our duty to God, who requireth it at our hands, and as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent thereof wee ſhall glorifie God, for it tends much to his praiſe and glory, when in ſuch works as himſelf hath commanded, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren teſtifie their obedience and thankfulneſs; and therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, if yee bring forth much fruit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 15.8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And by our Charity, as wee ſhall grace and adorn our holy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo wee ſhall ſtop the mouths of wicked men from ſpeaking any evil of us or of our profeſſion; for how are men apt to ſpeak of us, and of our profeſſion, according to the fruits wee bring forth, and the good works which wee do.</p>
            <p>And as wee ſhall thereby comfort, and make glad the hearts of the poor and diſtreſſed; ſo wee ſhall refreſh our own ſouls, in that our works of Charity will evidence our fruits to bee ſound and ſaving, lively and effectual; for as <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jacob, give mee Children or elſe I dye;</hi> in like manner ſaith Faith to the ſoul of a Chriſtian, <hi>Give mee Children,</hi> let mee bring forth good works, <hi>elſe I dye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2.26.</note> and have no life in me, according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>James, Faith
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46545:139"/> without works is dead,</hi> its not a living but a dead faith, that manifeſts not its life by working.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As Meditation, ſo <hi>Prayer</hi> is a ſpecial means on our part to bee performed, for attaining unto this grace of Charity. I ſay, earneſt and fervent prayer unto God for the ſame; for as hee is the fountain and author of every good gift, ſo hee hath ſanctified Prayer, as the means of obtaining every good gift from him.</p>
            <p>Bee earneſt therefore with God in Prayer, that he would be pleaſed to give thee as a compaſſionate heart towards the needs and neceſſities of the poor members of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo an open hand, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt freely and liberally contribute unto them, according to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and thy ability: Beg of God that as hee hath bleſſed thee with ſome competent eſtate, ſo he would add this mercy, to give thee an heart to give out proportionably to what hee hath given thee; and that in teſtimony of thy love, and thankfulneſs unto him. But alas how few are there who in their prayers unto God are mindful of this grace of Charity? how few are there who ever begged of God, that hee would bee pleaſed to implant this noble grace of Charity in their hearts? If upon examination thou findeſt thy ſelf to have been faulty therein: Go take up a new reſolution to be earneſt with God in prayer for this grace eſpecially, and never to give over, till thou finde it in ſome meaſure wrought in thy ſoul, till thou finde thy ſelf upon all good occaſions ready to diſtribute, and willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the needs and neceſſities of thy poor Brethren.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Diligence in our Callings,</hi> is another means on our part to be performed, for the practiſing of charity. Hee that would be charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the poor in their needs and neceſſities; muſt be diligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in his calling, ſo that hee may have wherewithall to expreſs his charity;<note place="margin">Prov. 10.4.

As therefore thou deſireſt to be charitable, bee careful to prevent all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary expences; I mean, let not thy apparel bee too coſtly, for how can it be expected, that they ſhould be charitable, ready to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the neceſſities of others, who lay out the greateſt part of their eſtates upon their backs. Neither let thy feaſtings be too frequent, nor too chargable; which is noted for one of the ſins of the old world, who were <hi>given to eating,</hi>

            <p>Now a ſacred ſtock for the Poor may bee raiſed two waies?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By ſetting apart ſomething every Lords day, out of thy comings in the week before, according as God hath proſpered thee;</hi> which practiſe wee finde preſcribed unto us, by the direction of the Holy Ghoſt, and warranted unto us by Apoſtolical authority, for ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 16.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>Now concerning the collection for the Saints, as I have given order to the Churches of Galatia, even ſo do yee.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>By conſecrating unto God a certain portion of thy yearly incomes and revenues for Charitable uſes;</hi> what this portion ſhould bee I dare not determine, the ſcripture being ſilent therein, only in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wee are commanded to give out proportionably to what God hath given unto us, that they who are rich in this worlds goods, bee rich in good works; But this I can ſay, that the moſt that I have heard or read of, who have taken this courſe to conſecrate unto God a certain portion of their eſtate to charitable uſes, have followed the example of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 28.22.</note> in giving a tenth part unto God. And as God did exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bleſs <hi>Jocob</hi> after his vow; ſo likewiſe hath hee bleſſed divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers after their vow unto God.</p>
            <p>An<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tho. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,</hi> in his funeral Sermon at the Burial of Mr. <hi>John Park<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> Merchant and Citizen of <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> eminent Divine of this City, now with God, in his funeral ſermon, at the Burial of a Merchant, ſpeaking of his <hi>Charity,</hi> ſaith, that at his firſt effectual call, among other things hee then reſolved upon, this was one, <hi>to ſet apart every year a tenth of his gain for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif of the poor;</hi> and that God from that time forward abundantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced his eſtate. And withall hee adds a paſſage very remarkable, and therefore I ſhall give it you in his own words, <q>True it is, that for ſome ſpace of time, ſome three or four years after that his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſetting a <hi>tenth</hi> apart for ſuch purpoſes, he thrived not, he found no increaſe, nor came forward in the world, as formerly hee had done, yet was hee not thereby diſcouraged, nor did hee forbear to bee bountiful, as opportunity was offered, and the neceſſity of poor people required it: But hee gave ſtill with chearfulneſs, and comfort out of love to God, conceiving that God in wiſedome and goodneſs proſpered him not, thereby to try his ſincerity to him, and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46545:140"/> his Charity to others; yea and that hee himſelf might thereby have experience of his love unto God, his Faith, Patience, and Conſtancy. But then hee adds from that time forward God abundantly advanced his eſtate, ſo that hee found experimentally all thoſe gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God true,<note place="margin">Pſa. 113.9.</note> of his bleſſing of him <hi>that diſperſeth and diſpenſeth to the poor;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 19.17.</note> 
                  <hi>and of the repayment of that with intereſt that is ſo lent to the Lord.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And from mine own experience, I can tell you of another yet liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who hath often acknowledged, that though hee had great trading, yet found hee no increaſe in his ſtock, but inſtead of going forward, hee went backward in the world. Whereupon hee promiſed unto God to be more careful in ſanctifying the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and dedicated unto him a Tenth of his encreaſe for charitable uſes, and then hee ſo thrived in his eſtate, that hee gave over his Calling, and ever ſince liveth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Rents. Many other inſtances could I give you of Gods extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary bleſſing on thoſe who have conſecrated a tenth of their eſtate unto God for charitable uſes, but theſe may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>Having thus done with the means on our part to be performed for attaining unto this Grace of Charity.</p>
            <p>Come wee now to the Motives, to quicken us up to a conſcionable performance of the works of it. I ſhall touch only upon theſe four,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Excellency of the duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Piety which it containeth in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Profit which ariſeth from it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Dammage which followeth upon the neglect thereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Motive or Inducement to Charity may be taken from <hi>the Excellency thereof.</hi> I ſuppoſe that all will grant that the greateſt excellency that a creature can attain unto, is to be like his Creator. That excellency wherein man was at firſt created, is thus ſet out,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>God created man in his own Image;</hi> that is, <hi>in his own likeneſs.</hi> And that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency wherewith wee ſhall be glorified in Heaven is ſet out by our likeneſs to Chriſt; for it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.21.</note> 
               <hi>Our bodies ſhall then bee faſhioned like unto his glorious body,</hi> yea in the whole man, <hi>when hee ſhall appear,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 3.2.</note> 
               <hi>then wee ſhall bee like him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now while wee live on earth, there is nothing wherein wee can ſhew our ſelves more like unto God, than in ſhewing mercy, and in ſuccouring ſuch as ſtand in need. When God ſets himſelf to proclaim his Name, hee moſt inſiſteth upon his <hi>mercifulneſs and goodneſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 34.6.</note> Chriſt himſelf doth preſs this Motive to enforce this duty, thus,<note place="margin">Luk. 6.36.</note> 
               <hi>Bee yee merciful, as your Father is merciful.]</hi> The excellency of Charity
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46545:141"/> doth herein further appear, that Chriſt hath ſet the poor in his own room; inſomuch as they who relieve the poor, do therein relieve Chriſt himſelf. So much do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h Chriſt acknowledge, where hee ſaith to ſuch as ſuccoured the poor,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.40.</note> 
               <hi>Inaſmuch as you have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, yee have done it unto mee:</hi> Is it not an excellent thing to relieve Chriſt? They then that relieve the poor, do an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent work. As it is a great aggravation of perſecuting the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Faith, becauſe therein they perſecute Chriſt himſelf, as is implied under this divine voice that affrighted <hi>Saul,</hi> while hee was breathing out threatnings and ſlaughter againſt the Diſciples of the Lord,<note place="margin">Act. 9.1, 4.</note> 
               <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou mee?</hi> So it is a great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of true Charity, that Chriſt himſelf is relieved thereby.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another Motive is the <hi>Piety,</hi> which in and by performing this duty of Alms-giving is manifeſted. Piety, I ſay to God. For <hi>pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and undefiled before God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 1.27.</note> 
               <hi>is this, to viſit the Fatherleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in their affliction.</hi> Here hee puts two particulars, for all kinds of Charity: And by this phraſe, <hi>Pure Religion before God is this,</hi> hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is but a meer ſhew of Religion that is without charity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That true Religion w ll make men charitable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Charity will prove men to be truly Religious.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That works of Charity are as acceptable to God, as duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.<note place="margin">Phil. 4.18.</note> For God accounts Charity <hi>an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a Sacrifice acceptable, and well-pleaſing unto him.</hi> The poor and needy are to God as the Altars of burnt-offerings, and incenſe were under the Law. Thoſe things which were laid on them, and offered up, were given to the Lord, and as a gift accepted by him. Even ſo are Alms given to the poor, the poor are the Altar, Alms the Sacrifice. Now who would not diſpoſe ſo of that which hee hath, as God may account it given to him, and anſwerably accept it? On this very ground doth the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to this duty in this manner,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.16</note> 
               <hi>To do good, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate forget not, for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> Thus wee ſee how works of Charity are not only uſeful and profitable to man, but alſo acceptable and well-pleaſing to God; which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion addeth much life to the duty here preſſed.<note place="margin">Omnes expeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus utilitatem, ad eam<expan>

            </p>
            <p n="3">III. A third Motive is, <hi>the manifold profit wherewith it is rewarded.</hi> Profit and advantage is the Motives, which, for the moſt part, ſpurs men on to labour and take pains, to riſe early, and ſit up late, to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture goods, life, and all they have. Witneſs the pains, travels, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and adventures of labourers, work-men, trades-men, Farmers,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46545:141"/> Merchants, Mariners, &amp;c. yet that profit which they aim at, is but earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and temporary; and their hope of attaining it uncertain. Surely works of Charity give an aſſured hope of far greater, and better profit than earth can afford.</p>
            <p>In general it is promiſed, <hi>That if wee caſt our bread upon the waters, wee ſhall finde it after many daies;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Faecundus eſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger pauperum, citò reddit do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantibus fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum.

               </note> If wee give Alms to the poor, where all wee do may ſeem to be caſt away, as if it were thrown into the Sea; yet in due time will it return to us with advantage. And leſt any ſhould be diſcouraged from doing works of Charity, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour aſſureth us, <hi>That whoſoever giveth but a cup of cold water</hi> (which is one of the leaſt acts of Charity wee can perform) <hi>ſhall in no wiſe loſe kis reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If in ſpecial it be demanded, what profit is there of Charity? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, (as the Apoſtle did of Circumciſion) <hi>much every way.</hi> Yea,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.12.</note> I may ſay of <hi>Charity,</hi> as the Apoſtle doth of <hi>Piety,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>There are among others two Metaphors often uſed by the Holy Ghoſt, in ſetting our Alms-giving, which do much amplifie the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity thence ariſing.</p>
            <p>One is taken from <hi>lending;</hi> The other from <hi>ſowing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Alms-giving is ſet forth in Scripture by <hi>lending;</hi> yea to ſuch a lending whereby wee have not only the principal reſtored, but with great increaſe. And whereas ſuch as put forth their mony unto men, can expect but ſix in the hundred; If wee in obedience to the command of God, ſhall freely part with our mony to the uſe of the poor, for their relief, wee ſhall receive an hundred for ſix, yea an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for one,<note place="margin">Mark 10.30.</note> and eternal life to boot. And wee need not to doubt of the payment; for though the poor be never ſo unable, yet wee have an all-ſufficient <hi>Surety,</hi> even God himſelf, who hath undertaken to pay whatſoever is thus put forth,<note place="margin">Prov. 19.17.</note> according to that of the Wiſe-man, <hi>Hee that hath pitty upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord, and that which hee hath given, will hee pay him again.</hi> Where you have Gods counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond to ſave you harmleſs, in which hee both acknowledgeth the debt, and promiſeth payment. And what better ſecurity can any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire than a bond under Gods own hand? The conſideration whereof ſhould mee-thinks make us willing to embrace any opportunity of putting out our mony to this great advantage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the other Metaphor of <hi>ſowing,</hi> it is in Scripture applied to Alms-giving,<note place="margin">Pſal. 112.9.</note> under this phraſe, <hi>Hee hath diſperſed.</hi> As the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man diſperſeth his ſeed which hee ſoweth in the earth; ſo doth the Alms-giver, his Alms, therefore this is added by way of expoſition, <hi>Hee hath given to the poor.</hi> The Apoſtle alſo applieth unto Alms-giving this proverbial ſpeech, <hi>Hee which ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap ſparingly;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.6.</note> 
               <hi>and hee which ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully.</hi> Now
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46545:142"/> what is it that ordinarily bringeth forth a greater increaſe than ſowing ſeed in fertile ground? It is ſaid of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that hee <hi>ſowed in the Land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 26.12.</note> 
               <hi>and received in the ſame year an hundred-fold.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>good ground beareth fruit, ſome an hundred-fold, ſome ſixty-fold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13.8.</note> 
               <hi>ſome thirty-fold.</hi> Now Alms-giving is one of thoſe things that ſhall receive an hundred-fold, and ſhall inherit everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>If therefore profit and advantage may be a Motive to ſtir us up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any thing, ſurely it ſhould be a Motive to incite us unto liberality in Alms-giving, to be bountiful in contributing to the relief of the poor.</p>

                  </gap>est and ſafeſt way of getting.</hi> For though Husband-men may ſometimes loſe the benefit of their ſeed ſowen, through mill-dews, or unſeaſonable weather, and ſuch as put their mony to uſe may come ſhort of their principal, yet hee who with an honeſt, and ſincere heart giveth to the poor, ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward. For as the Wiſe-man ſpeaketh, <hi>There is that ſcattereth, and yet encreaſeth;</hi> Prov. 11.24. intimating unto us, that this ſcattering is the beſt way of encreaſing. And indeed ſo it is, for hath not our Saviour promiſed,<note place="margin">Luk. 6.35.</note> 
               <hi>That if wee give, it ſhall bee given unto us good meaſure preſſed down, and ſhaken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?</hi> Here God gives us as it were a bill of his hand, and enters into bond, and becomes Surety with the poor, that what wee give ſhall be repayed with advantage. This is a <hi>Paradox</hi> to worldly men, that <hi>giving ſhould bee the ſureſt and ſafeſt way of getting and encreaſing,</hi> yet nothing more clearly laid down in the Scripture, and found to be true by the experience of all Gods people.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Motive and Inducement is <hi>the dammage which may enſue upon the neglect of Alms-giving.</hi> Though it argue a kinde of ſervile diſpoſition to be moved with fear of loſs or pain to a duty; yet of that diſpoſition are many; and in that reſpect this may be added as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to the duty.</p>
            <p>The dammage that may ariſe upon the neglect of Charity, when it ought to be ſhewed, is in the kinde thereof as large, as the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned benefits of performing the duty in the kinde of it.</p>
            <p>For neglect of the duty doth not only cauſe a forfeiture of all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned benefits ariſing from the performance thereof, but alſo pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon the neglectors head many evils. Where the Wiſe-man ſaith, <hi>The merciful man doth good to his own ſoul;</hi> hee addeth,<note place="margin">Prov. 11.17.</note> 
               <hi>but hee that is cruel, troubleth his own fleſh. Soul and Fleſh</hi> are the two eſſential parts of a man; both the one and the other are Synecdochically put for the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46545:143"/> whole man; even for the perſon, By a <hi>cruel</hi> man, is meant an unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or a hard-hearted-man; for hee is oppoſed to a merciful man. The meaning then of the proverb is this; As a merciful man doth good not only to his poor Brother, to whom hee ſheweth mercy, but alſo to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: So an hard-hearted-man doth not only grieve his diſtreſſed neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in affording him no ſuccour, but alſo brings much dammage to himſelf.<note place="margin">Prov. 11.24.</note> 
               <hi>For hee that with-holdeth more than is meet, cometh to poverty.</hi> With-holding is there oppoſed to ſcattering, which word hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to caſting or ſowing ſeed on the earth to bring forth a crop; and thereby is meant Alms-giving. On the contrary, <hi>With-holding more than is meet,</hi> implies a denial of Alms, when there is juſt cauſe to give. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and equity require this duty (as wee have before ſhewed) ſo as that phraſe doth much aggravate this kind of unmercifulneſs; and as a juſt puniſhment thereof, that which covetous men by refuſing to give, ſeek to prevent, ſhall fall upon them, even <hi>poverty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if in any diſtreſs they ſhall be forced to ſeek help of others, even they ſhall bee neglected as they neglected others. The Wiſe-man teſtifieth as much in theſe words,<note place="margin">Prov. 21.13.</note> 
               <hi>Whoſo ſtoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, hee alſo ſhall cry himſelf, and not bee heard.</hi> Not only other men,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.24.</note> but alſo God himſelf will refuſe to hear his cry. <hi>Dives,</hi> who refuſed to relieve <hi>Lazarus,</hi> could not obtain any to afford him a drop of water to cool his tongue, when hee was tormented in Hell flames. It is expreſly ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.33.</note> that <hi>hee ſhall have judgement without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy,</hi> James 2.13. For God deals with men according to their dealing with others.</p>
            <p>Finally, as bleſſings are promiſed to merciful men, ſo curſes are denounced againſt unmerciful men.<note place="margin">Prov. 28.27.</note> As under bleſſings, all manner of good things are comprized, ſo under curſes, all manner of evils. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful men ſhall have the curſes of men,<note place="margin">Prov. 11.26.</note> and <hi>people ſhall curſe them.</hi> And at the great day of judgement, they ſhall be pronounced curſed by the great Judge. <hi>For then ſhall hee ſay unto them on the left hand, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from mee, yee curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels:</hi>

There are beleevers of ſeveral growths in the Church of God:<note n="m" place="margin">1 Ioh. 2.13.14</note> Fathers, Young men, Children, and<note n="n" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2.</note> Babes; and as in moſt families there are more babes and children, than grown men, ſo in the Church of God, there are more weak doubting Chriſtians, than ſtrong ones, grown up to a full aſſurance. A Babe may bee born and yet not know it, ſo a man may bee born again and not be ſure of it. Sometimes they think they have grounds of hope, that they ſhall bee ſaved, ſometimes they think they have grounds of fears, that they ſhall bee condemned: not knowing which might bee moſt weighty, like a pair of ballances, they are in equal poyſe. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.6. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, that the light ſhall not bee clear nor dark.</hi>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:46545:144"/> It is ſpoken primarily of Gods providential diſpenſations, towards his Church in Goſpel times; For a while ſhee ſhould live <hi>in Crepuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> in twilight: in a mixt condition of light and darkneſs, comfort and affliction; like a man in a miſty morning, that neither w lketh in the dark, nor yet hath the light clear to ſee far before him; like <hi>Paul</hi> and the Marriners that ſaw neither Sun nor Stars for many daies,<note n="o" place="margin">Acts 27.20.</note> ſo might it bee with a particular perſon, in reference to his ſpiritual condition.</p>

            <p>Secondly.

To Faith as true, and not as ſtrong; they may bee ſure of heaven, and yet in their own ſenſe, not aſſured of heaven. As an Infant may bee born to a great eſtate, and have a certain title to it, but yet hee might not know it, or make it out to himſelf or others. So that the Queſtion is not <hi>de certitudine objecti,</hi> of the certainty of Salvation, but <hi>de certitudine ſubjecti,</hi> of the apprehenſion, ſenſe and knowledge of the beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſon, concerning his ſalvation.</p>

That in divers men, there are divers degrees of this aſſurance, and in the fame man different degrees at divers times, but in no man at any time, in this life perfection of degrees; For our underſtanding is imperfect, both as to the faculty and its acts. And though the minde is curing, yet it will not bee perfectly cured in this life, from that darkneſs that beefel it, by mans Apoſtacy from God. For wee have but an imperfect knowledge of Faith and Love: and while wee have but an imperfect knowledge of the premiſes, wee cannot give a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect aſſent to the concluſion. And no man hath ſuch perfection of degrees, of the aſſurance of his ſalvation, <hi>in an ordinary way,</hi> as that one degree more cannot bee added to the former; neither is there any repugnancy in aſſerting an infallible aſſurance, and denying a perfect aſſurance, for I infallibly know that there is a God, and that
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46545:145"/> this God is good and juſt; and yet I have not a perfect knowledge of a deity; or of his goodneſs and juſtice, for in this life wee know but in part. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11, 12.</p>
            <p>There are three waies that wee come to a certainty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a certainty that comes by ſenſe,<note place="margin">A threefold certainty.</note> which cannot erre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its proper object, when there is a due diſtance, a fit diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Organ, and the medium rightly diſpoſed: thus <hi>Thomas</hi> was certain of Chriſts reſurrection from the dead. <hi>John</hi> 20.25. <hi>The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſciples ſaid unto him, wee have ſeen the Lord, but hee ſaid unto them, except I ſhall ſee in his hands the Print of the nailes, and put my finger into the Print of the nailes, and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not beleeve.</hi> verſ. 27. <hi>Hee ſaith to</hi> Thomas, <hi>reach hither thy fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and behold my hands, reach hither thy hand, and thruſt it into my ſide, and bee not faithleſs but beleeving.</hi> Verſ. 28. <hi>And</hi> Thomas <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, my Lord, and my God.</hi> Though the other Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples told him they had ſeen the Lord, yet hee would not take it for a certainty from their report, except hee had a certainty from his own ſenſe. But the Papiſts do not only deny us a certainty of faith, but alſo a certainty of ſenſe, for though in the Sacrament wee ſee it is real bread, and taſt it to bee real bread, and feel and handle it as real bread, yet contrary to our ſenſe, would have us beleeve, and ſay it is tranſubſtantiated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a certainty of ſcience, or knowledge ariſing from firſt principles, received by all, that are proved by their own light, that cannot bee demonſtrated <hi>a priori,</hi> becauſe there is nothing true before them; as a man cannot ſhew you the Sun but by its own light; So I certainly know that both parts of a contradiction cannot bee true; ſo I certainly know, that the whole is greater than any particular part.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is certainty of authority, or teſtimony, if the teſtimony bee Humane, it begets but a moral perſwaſion; for no humane teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is of neceſſary verity, becauſe truth is not neceſſarily, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently and mutably in the man that gives this teſtimony, and the teſtimony hath not its cogency or validity from it ſelf, but from the qualifications of the perſon that bears the teſtimony, whence there is a gradual certainty in humane teſtimonies; only God is ſo <hi>neceſſarily</hi> true, that it ſhould imply a contradiction that hee ſhould bee God, and yet lye. <hi>God cannot lye;</hi> Tit. 1.2. So that a Divine teſtimony begets a certainty of divine Faith, for what God ſaith, I undoubtedly know to bee true, becauſe truth is<note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 32.4.34.6. Heb. 6.18.</note> eſſential to him; for if truth bee neceſſary to the teſtatour, the truth of the teſtimony muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46545:146"/> bee<note n="f" place="margin">John 17.17.</note> true, ſo I know that the impenitent unbeleeving perſon that dyeth without grace, and an intereſt in Chriſt, ſhall certainly<note n="g" place="margin">Mar 16.16.

Can I know what I approve, eſteem moſt, and delight in moſt, and breath, and pant after moſt, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things and not in this? it is true, conſcience is naturally blinde, in ſpiritual things, but yet directed by the word, and inlightned by the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46545:147"/> ſpirit, might paſs a judgement upon a man: For as the Moon bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth light from the Sun, and ſo communicateth light unto the world, which elſe it could not do: ſo conſcience receiving light from the word, and ſpirit, diſcovereth what elſe it could not do. So it is called the candle of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. <hi>The ſpirit of a man is the candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the belly:</hi> Not only taking notice of the outward acts in the life; but the inward motions of the heart, not only of ſome, but it hath a power to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of them all: Conſcience is like the urine which diſcovereth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a perſon bee ſound in health, or ſhews what his diſtemper is. By the Eccho, cauſed by the reflexion of the ſound, a man heareth his word, after hee hath ſpoken it: ſo by the reflecting power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, a man views his actions after they are done, and hears his words after they bee ſpoken. A man fees his ſpots or beauty in the glaſs, by the reflexion of the ſpecies, that do repreſent them to his view. As <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethrens conſciences told them that they were true men, and not<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 42.31.</note> ſpies; ſo conſcience may truly tell a man, that hee is ſincere, and not an hypocrite.

            <p>Now that the Scripture containeth Characters of ſincerity, and that a man comparing himſelf by thoſe Characters, might certainly know that hee is ſincere; will bee evidenced by theſe Scriptures. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Keep back thy ſervant from preſumptuous ſins, let them not have dominion over mee:</hi> then mark <hi>[then] ſhall I bee upright.</hi> When there is no one known ſin, but a man is really willing ſhould be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and parted with, his <hi>moſt beloved</hi> ſin that is neereſt to him, which by way of propriety hee may call his own, in an eſpecial manner, which is the laſt ſin a man parteth with, and if there bee any ſin which a man is unwilling to part with, and will keep a man off from Chriſt, it is his boſome ſin, his darling; and the truth is, that if any man keep, love any one ſin, which hee will not let go, to cloſe fully with Chriſt, let his profeſſion bee never ſo great, hee is an hypocrite. Some men part with Chriſt for one luſt, for one ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.22. <hi>When Jeſus heard theſe things,</hi> how far he had gone, how much he had done, <hi>hee ſaid unto him, yet lackeſt thou one thing.</hi> Love to his riches, and prizing them more than Chriſt was his ruine; one ſtab at the heart
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46545:147"/> with a Pen-knife, will as certainly kill a man, as a thouſand wounds with a ſword; one diſeaſe that is mortal, will as certainly bring a man to his grave, as twenty; and one leak in a ſhip, will ſink it, as more. <hi>Herod</hi> did many things, but yet hee would not let go his <hi>Herodias. Mark</hi> 6.17, 18, 19, 20. It is a ſure rule, that which a man loves moſt, hee will indeavour to keep longeſt, Skin for skin, all that a man hath will hee give for his life. A man prizeth his right hand much, but his head more, and therefore to ſave his head, hee will hold up his hand, and venture the loſs of the one, to ſave the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There may bee many ſins a man might love, but one eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hee may bee willing the other ſhould bee pared off to preſerve that, but when hee is willing to leave all, to indulge himſelf in none, no not his darling ſin; it is a ſign of ſincerity. Conſult theſe Scriptures; <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 17.1, 3, 4. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119.1, 2, 3, 6. <hi>Job</hi> 1, 8. &amp; 2.3. &amp; 31. cap. throughout.</p>

Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> knew his ſincerity; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. Hee had the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his conſcience, and was ſure of it, elſe how could hee have made his appeal to God? <hi>Remember now, oh Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi>

            <p>But here the Papiſt doth not only cavil, but the drooping diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſtian alſo queſtioneth all this, becauſe of the deceitfulneſs of the heart.

For this conſider theſe four things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Another man cannot know it; I cannot certainly and infallibly know whether another man be ſincere, or what his heart is, for it is the prerogative and excellency of God to bee <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. A wicked mans heart is ſo wicked, and there is ſuch a depth of wickedneſs in his heart, that hee cannot come to the bottome of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If a man cannot know all the ſecret turnings, and windings of his heart, yet hee may know the general ſcope, and frame of his heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If hee could not do this of himſelf yet aſſiſted by the ſpirit of God; which all beleevers have received, hee might know the frame, bent, ſcope, inclination of his own heart.</p>
            <p>Thus far the firſt propoſition, that a man may know that hee hath ſincere faith in Chriſt, and love to God. Now wee proceed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Propoſition which ſhews the connexion, between grace and glory.</note>Second Propoſition is this; <hi>that there is an infallible connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween juſtifying faith, unfeigned love, and eternal glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle tells us of ſome things that may bee called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. <hi>things that accompany ſalvation.</hi> Having, or contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation, that are contiguous to ſalvation, that the one toucheth the other; this muſt bee proved, for elſe though I know I do beleeve and love God ſincerely to day, I can have no infallible aſſurance of ſalvation, becauſe this may bee loſt before to morrow, or before I dye. Now this I ſhall indeavour to prove by theſe three following particulars.<note place="margin">1 From the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Gods promiſes.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The undoubted verity of Gods promiſes, proveth an inſeperable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:46545:149"/> between ſincere grace, and eternal glory.</hi> Faith is the eye of the ſoul, &amp; with it, through a promiſe, as through a perſpective-glaſs, can the ſoul have a view of Heaven and glory. What greater certainty or ſecurity can a man have, than the infallible promiſe of that God who is truth it ſelf; who will not deny his Word, but the ſame Love and free Grace that moved him to infuſe Grace into thy heart, and to make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, will move him alſo to give the thing promiſed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that hee gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth on him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Joh. 5.24. <hi>Hee that beleeveth hath everlaſting life:</hi> Hee hath it in the Promiſe, hee hath it in the firſt-fruits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. — <hi>But wee our ſelves alſo which have the firſt-fruits of the Spirit.</hi> — The Jews by offering their firſt fruits, did teſtifie their thankfulneſs to God for what they had received, and hopes of the full crop in due time. Hee <hi>hath everlasting life,</hi> then it muſt not end, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Hee that beleeveth and is baptized, ſhall bee ſaved: Hee that beleeveth not ſhall bee damned.</hi> As certainly as the unbeleever ſhall be caſt into outer darkneſs, ſo certainly ſhall the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever be partaker of the glorious Inheritance of the Saints in Light. <hi>The Promiſe is as true as the Threatning,</hi> Act. 16.30, 31. There you ſee a poor convinced, wounded ſinner, under the load of guilt, that had a ſight of his loſt, undone, deplorable condition coming to the Apoſtles, and ſpeaking after this manner, <hi>Yee men of God, yee ſervants of the Lord, if there bee any way for mee, who have been ſo great a ſinner, that have done enough ten thouſand times over, to damn my own ſoul; if there be any certain way to avoid damnation, I beſeech you tell mee, if there be any means by which I might certainly be ſaved, as you pitty my ſinful ſoul, my bleeding heart, my wounded conſcience, tell mee what it is, declare it to mee.</hi> What is the Apoſtles anſwer? <hi>Beleeve on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> The Apoſtles ſpeak not doubtingly, <hi>perhaps</hi> thou ſhalt be ſaved, perhaps thou mayeſt be damned. If thou get Faith, <hi>it may be</hi> thou mayeſt get Heaven. Alas! what relief, peace, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction would this have been to his wounded conſcience? But they ſpeak <hi>peremptorily, beleeve and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> So that prove thou, that thou haſt Faith, and theſe Scriptures prove thou ſhalt have ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The Connexion therefore will not be queſtioned, if I beleeve I ſhall be ſaved; this God hath promiſed, but ſhall not a beleever loſe his Faith in Chriſt, and loſe his Love to God; for the Remonſtrants grant that a beleever <hi>qua talis,</hi> as a beleever cannot fall away, not come ſhort of glory; but <hi>qui talis est;</hi> Hee that is a beleever may fall
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:46545:150"/> away totally and finally, and ſo cannot have aſſurance of ſalvation, becauſe hee hath no aſſurance that hee ſhall perſevere in his beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſtate of grace. To this I oppoſe theſe places of Scripture, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23, 24. <hi>And the very God of Peace ſanctifie you wholly;</hi> and I pray <hi>God your whole ſpirit, and ſoul, and body, bee preſerved blameleſs</hi> (therefore preſerved from Apoſtacy, which is exceedingly blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy) till when; <hi>till the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> is this a prayer and not a promiſe? yea, it is a prayer indited by the Spirit of God, and hath a promiſe following it, if you will read on. <hi>Faithful is hee that calleth you, who alſo will do it.</hi> Here the Apoſtle that had the Spirit, prayeth for perſeverance; and the Apoſtle that had the Spirit, promiſeth perſeverance. Certainty then of perſeverance doth not make men careleſs in the uſe of means, not prayers needleſs; by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man obtains the thing promiſed, and the certainty that hee hath by the promiſe of obtaining, puts life into his prayers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident of this very thing, that hee which hath begun a good work in you,</hi>

God doth promiſe this abſolutely, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38, 40. <hi>And they ſhall bee my people, and I will bee their God, and will make an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good, but I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from mee.</hi> They ſhall not forſake God, becauſe God will not leave them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>And I will put my Spirit into you, and [cauſe] you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgements and do them.</hi> As abſolute as was the Covenant with <hi>Noah,</hi> that hee would not drown the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.9, 10. Beſides, as God doth make conditional Promiſes of Pardon and Salvation to thoſe that beleeve, and repent, ſo hee doth promiſe to give the condition, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. And herein is one ſpecial difference betwixt the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace; for God promiſed happineſs to man under the Covenant of Works, if hee perſevered in yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect Obedience, but did not promſe to keep him from depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him. So that a conditional promiſe is ſufficient ſecurity, where the condition is certain, and doth not infer the uncertainty of the Promiſe, but where the condition is doubtful. Theſe places alſo

               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledgeth, that this is the hardeſt place of Scripture for him to anſwer, in all the Book of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. it is ſet forth by a well of water ſpringing up to everlaſting life. A beleever is born of incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. An Hypocrite, like a ſtake, hath no root, and therefore may be plucked up, but a real beleever hath grace rooted in him, and therefore like a tree rooted in the earth ſtands faſt.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, no man can certainly bee aſſured of Salvation, becauſe God hath no where made a particular promiſe to any perſon, by name, and nothing is to be beleeved with a Divine Faith, but what is expreſly contained in the Word of God. Hee hath not ſaid, <hi>Thou Cornelius ſhalt bee ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this is anſwered, <hi>That all particulars are contained under the Univerſals.</hi> If all men be rational creatures, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> be a man, wee muſt conclude that <hi>Cornelius</hi> is a rational creature. How will they prove that there is an infallible certainty, that every particular perſon ſhall come to judgement. For God hath not ſaid, and thou <hi>Cornelius ſhalt come to judgement.</hi> In the commands that are given to all men, that they ſhall not commit Adultery. How will they prove that this reaches every particular man; for where hath God ſaid, <hi>Thou Cornelius ſhalt not commit Adultery?</hi> Thus this is proved from the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of Gods Promiſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. From the prevalency of Chriſts prayers</note> 
               <hi>The prevalency of Chriſts interceſſion for thoſe that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and love God, doth demonſtrate the inſeparable connexion between Grace and Glory.</hi> For wee know, that what Chriſt prayeth for ſhall be granted, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.42. <hi>And I know that thou heareſt mee alwaies.</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>I am perſwaded,</hi> though ſometimes it ſignifies no more than a moral perſwaſion, or probable conjecture; yet it doth not exclude a certainty of knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 14. <hi>I know, and am perſwaded by the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that there is nothing unclean of it ſelf;</hi> That is, I certainly know; it muſt therefore be judged by the circumſtances of the text.</p>

The ſum of this might be gathered up in this Syllogiſm. Thoſe that may certainly know, that they do ſincerely beleeve, and love God, may certainly know that they ſhall be ſaved; But a real beleever may certainly know that hee doth ſincerely beleeve and love God; therefore hee may certainly know that hee ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Thus far of the firſt Argument from our graces, and the infallible connexion between them and glory, becauſe I may be judged to be too long in this, I will bee ſhorter in the reſt, that I may come to the ſecond part of the Queſtion.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Some that <hi>for want of diligence in the uſe of means,</hi> are uncertain what their condition is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such as have made inquiry, and long earneſtly to bee reſolved in this great Queſtion, whether they bee converted, changed, and ſhall bee ſaved or no, and yet cannot finde it out. I would ſpeak a few things to the firſt of theſe, becauſe the greateſt part know not their condition, through their own careleſneſs and negligence, that through the <hi>ſlothfulneſs</hi> of their own hearts, on the <hi>difficulty</hi> of the work, or <hi>multiplicity</hi> of worldly care and buſineſs, are yet in the dark. That examine their ſhop book oftener, &amp; more diligently than they do the book of their own hearts; that make oftner enquiry whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they grow rich, than whether they wax good. If I may judge of other mens hearts by mine own, in this point, and not bee thought to have too hard, and uncharitable thoughts of them, I would conclude we are all guilty of negligence in this caſe, and therefore walk in the dark, and remain in uncertainties about the ſalvation of our immortal Souls, which ſhould bee the firſt thing wee ſhould make ſure of, becauſe it is of the greateſt and everlaſting concernment. Ah Chriſtian! chide thy own ſlothful, lazy, negligent heart; ſhame thy ſelf out of this
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:46545:153"/> careleſneſs; what, canſt thou eat, and drink, and ſleep, and trade as quietly as if thou wert paſt all danger? And yet thou doſt not know whether thou ſhalt be damned, or ſaved. Awake oh my ſoul! rouſe up thy ſelf, and look after thine eternal ſtate; it is no matter whether thou art rich or poor, honourable or contemptible, the great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that with the greateſt ſeriouſneſs is to bee reſolved, is whether thou haſt grace or no, whether Chriſt bee thine or no; certainly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perſons ſhould bee ſtirred up to looke after their eternal ſtate, and thoſe that are diligent need ſome conſiderations to make them more diligent, and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> writeth to thoſe that had obtained like precious faith with himſelf, calling upon them, urging and exhorting them to make their calling and election ſure. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.

            <p n="3">3. Doſt thou not too much forget thine own Mortality; doſt thou indeed conſider that thou art haſting into an eternal ſtate, and muſt within theſe few years, months, yea weeks, enter into an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition? doſt thou indeed beleeve Heaven or Hell is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee? that eternal death, or eternal life, are at the end of this fading, ſhort, momentany life? or doſt thou judge it to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, whether bee the place of thine everlaſting abode? what is the matter? Good Lord! what ſloth, ſtupidity, negligence, hath poſſeſſed our hearts! ſurely if thou didſt beleeve that thou mighteſt bee in thy grave to morrow, wouldeſt thou not make ſure of heaven to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:46545:154"/> day? if the leaſe of thy houſe be almoſt expired; and the Land-lord hath given thee warning to provide thee another Habitation, for hee will not ſuffer thee to renew it any more, doſt thou not preſently enquire of thy friends, and of thy neighbours, Sirs, can you tell mee where I may have a convenient dwelling, I have but a little time in the houſe where I am, and I have had warning to go out by ſuch a day? art thou not careful to have an houſe ready to go to upon the very ſame day thou leaveſt the former? Alas! <hi>man,</hi> doſt thou not know the leaſe of thy life is almoſt out? nay, doſt thou not know that thou art only a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at will, and God may turn thee out at an hours, at a moments warning? and yet doſt thou not make ſure of an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens? hath not God given thee warning? did thy head never ake? was thy heart never ſick? ſurely if thou didſt not forget thy own mortality, thou wouldeſt be more careful, painful, diligent in thy buſineſs. I ſee frequently men upon their ſick-beds, when they think they <hi>muſt</hi> dye, begin to inquire after Heaven, and how they may know their ſins are pardoned, and whether their ſouls ſhall be ſaved; becauſe the apprehenſion of the neerneſs of the grave, doth rouze them; and for all thou knoweſt, thou, though now in health, mayeſt be as ſoon in thy grave, as hee that lieth ſick. God can ſtop thy breath when hee pleaſeth. Art thou mortal? look then after thy ſoul.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is not this too great a ſleighting of the comforts of the Spirit? of God? of Chriſt and Happineſs? is there not ſo much excellency in all theſe, and ſweetneſs in diſcerning thy propriety to them, as to provoke thee to diligence, in making ſure of them?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Doſt not thou know that others have looked long after it, and doſt thou think thou ſhalt come ſo eaſily to it? others have prayed much, and ſearched themſelves often, and yet have not been able to ſatisfie all their own doubts, whether they have gone farther than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any hypocrite went; and doſt thou think it will be ſo eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, whether thy heart be ſincere with God? many finde it a hard thing to diſtinguiſh betwixt the higheſt degrees of common grace in hypocrites, and the loweſt degrees of ſaving grace in a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Doſt thou think that conſcience will never be awakened to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet thee, when thou canſt not ſatisfie it about thy ſalvation? will it alwaies be in this ſpiritual ſlumber? doſt thou think that ſickneſs will never come? and that death will never come? and that trouble will never ſeize upon thee? when thy conſcience ſhall be ſo alarmed, that thou wouldeſt give all thou art worth to know what ſhall become of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:46545:154"/> thy ſoul? oh then for an infallible evidence of Gods Love! oh then that thou mighteſt know whether God will pardon thy ſin, and ſave thy ſoul! oh dreadful caſe! when thou comeſt to dye, and conſcience ſhall accuſe thee for thy ſloth, when thou feeleſt thy ſpirit begin to fail, and apprehendeſt thy ſelf neer the grave, and conſcience rageth, and is not at peace, becauſe thou doſt not know whether thou ſhalt go to Heaven or Hell. It is dreadful, doleful, ſad to hear theſe complaints from a dying man: oh woe is mee, that I muſt take my farewell of all my friends, and death is impatient of delay, and yet I cannot ſay my ſins are pardoned! oh woe is mee, though I lye a dying, I cannot ſay my ſins are pardoned! within a little while my body muſt be carried from my bed to my grave; but oh it breaks my heart that I cannot tell whether my ſoul, my precious (and yet too much neglected) Soul ſhall be carried to Heaven by holy Angels? or dragged down to Hell by curſed devils! oh that God would grant mee a month or two, a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that I may work out my ſalvation! but thy conſcience ſhall tell thee, thou hadſt time, but thou didſt miſ-ſpend it; thou hadſt it, but thou didſt not improve it in getting this grand Queſtion reſolved, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou hadſt made thy peace with God. Conſider now how dreadful it will be, when conſcience is awakened, and thou in this caſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If thou be a true Chriſtian, yet herein doſt thou not act too much like the careleſs ungodly world? they take no care to make ſure of Heaven, and wilt thou juſtifie their practice, and harden them in it? There are ſome carnal ones in the family; a carnal husband, or a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wife, or ungodly children, or graceleſs ſervants, that minds not God, nor care for their ſouls, that look not after Heaven; and wilt thou be guilty of incouraging them in their careleſneſs, and hardening them in their forgetfulneſs of God, by thine own remiſſeneſs? but if thou waſt ſerious in the uſe of means, preſſing, following hard after God, thy ſtrictneſs might ſhame them out of their wickedneſs; and might reflect upon themſelves, if ſuch a one that lives ſo circumſpectly, and taketh ſuch pains in duties, and yet doubteth, and fears, and would fain be reſolved; what a careleſs wretch am I, never to regard my own ſoul; they are ignorant of God, and his excellency; of Chriſt, and his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; of Grace, and its neceſſity; and therefore deſire them not, nor care to make ſure of them; but God hath opened thine eyes, to ſee all theſe.

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:46545:159"/> preſently boil over. I am <hi>Joſeph</hi> your Brother, I will ſhew you kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, be not troubled, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.1. and the following verſes. While thou followeſt God with thy complaints, and preſſeſt hard after Chriſt; hee will at length ſhew, and make known himſelf unto thee. Oh thou weeping ſinner, I am Jeſus thy Brother, I am thy Redeemer, I will be thy Saviour, though thou haſt dealt unkindly with mee, yet I will receive thee with the ſweet embracements of my everlaſting love. Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Alwaies be more obſervant of the purpoſe and diſpoſition of thy heart, the inclination of thy will, the general ſcope of thy life, than the paſſionate ſenſe of joy and comfort.</hi> There is but little conſtancy in theſe joyes, like the tide, they ebbe and flow.

               <p>Sixthly, <hi>When thou canſt not experience the ſweetneſs of the Promiſe, yet then firmly beleeve the verity of the Promiſe.</hi> The Truth of the Promiſe doth not depend upon our ſenſe and feeling of it, eſpecially when wee would; there might be <hi>evidentia cred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bilitatis,</hi> when there is not <hi>evidentia rei,</hi> ſufficient reaſon to beleeve, becauſe it is a promiſe made by God, when thou doſt not as yet ſee the performance of it. Though thou haſt not taſted honey, yet thou wilt beleeve it to be ſweet, if told by one that hath eaten thereof.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Carry thy ſelf really towards thy ſin; as thou doſt conceive through mistake God doth towards thee.</hi> Thou ſayeſt, God doth not love thee, be ſure thou doſt not love thy ſin; thou ſayeſt, hee hath caſt thee off, be ſure thou caſt off thy ſin; ſmile as <hi>little</hi> upon thy ſin, as in thy <hi>greateſt darkneſs</hi> of diſcomfort, thou ſayeſt God doth upon thee. Lighten the ſhip by caſting thy ſins over-board, and thou ſhalt come ſafe to ſhoar. This Ecclipſe may be by the interpoſition of ſome ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thee; and the light of Gods countenance.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>Diligently obſerve what grace is of the greateſt growth in thy ſoul, and make the beſt improvement of that for thy ſupport.</hi> The body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural doth grow in all the parts of it, but not equally, as to all dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; the finger grows not to the magnitude of the wriſt or arm; In mixt bodies there are all the elements, but one is predominant. Amongſt the many branches of a tree, one might out-top all the reſt. In a ring of Bells all ſound, but the great Bell is heard above them all. In the New Creature there are all Graces <hi>radically</hi> and <hi>ſeminally,</hi> but yet one might bee more eminent than the reſt. In ſome
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:46545:160"/> Faith (<note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 15.28.</note>;) in ſome love to God (<note n="y" place="margin">Luk. 7.44, 47.</note>;) in ſome ſorrow for ſin (<note n="z" place="margin">2 Cor. 2.7. 2 Chron. 33.12</note>;) as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every ſin is <hi>radically</hi> in every wicked man, yet ſome ſin is grown to a greater height, and like <hi>Saul,</hi> is taller than the reſt; in one, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in another, paſſion; in another, pride.</p>
               <p>Moral vertues are connexed <hi>communi vinculo,</hi> with a common bond, yet they may be in ſeveral degrees: Some have them <hi>in gradu conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentiae,</hi> that though the diſorders and perturbations of the ſoul are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry urgent and preſſing, yet a man is able to reſiſt and to ſuppreſs them. Some <hi>in gradu temperantiae,</hi> when the paſſions are more ſedate and calm; ſome <hi>in gradu heroico,</hi> when they are ſo ſubdued and reſtrained, that they are ſubject to the Government and Rule of Right Reaſon, the Guide and Leader of the ſoul. Now that grace that is moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, is eaſily diſcerned. Make uſe of that.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>Blear not thine eyes, by alwaies poring upon thy ſin, and wants, that are the reaſon of thy doubts and fears, but ſtudy alſo the Righteouſneſs and fulneſs of Chriſt, for the ſupport of hope and confidence.</hi> Know, that if thou hadſt never ſo little ſin,<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> yet thou haſt need of a Saviour, and if thou haſt never ſo much, he is willing and ſufficient (<note n="b" place="margin">Iſa. 1.18.</note>;) if thou hadſt never ſo much ſorrow, and inherent grace, thou muſt be juſtified by the mirits of Chriſt alone<note n="c" place="margin">Job 9.21. 1 Cor. 4.4. Phil. 3.8, 9.</note> and if thou haſt but ſo much as is true and ſincere, thou art juſtified, and ſhalt be<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 12.20.</note> ſaved. Set thy Faith on work therefore, to lay hold upon Chriſt, and Faith will ſuck ſtrength from Chriſt, as the childe doth cleave to the Mother by the navel, and receive nouriſhment from her; a twigg that is ſhaken by every wind, yet tied to the body of a tree, it ſtandeth faſt; eye thy ſin to caſt thee down, and Chriſts Righteouſneſs to raiſe thee up.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>Bee more in practice than in diſputes, and wherein thou wouldeſt inform thy judgement, proceed in a right method.</hi> Many weak Chriſtians cannot ſee the complexions of their faces, becauſe they are alwaies looking into troubled waters, ſearching into needleſs diſputes and queſtions, notional knowledge in the Scripture will never cure thy diſtemper, no more than bare reading of <hi>Galen,</hi> or the works of ſome Phyſician will recover a man from a fit of ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>And where thou wouldeſt be informed, proceed in a right method, queſtion not thy election firſt, but thy true converſion. <hi>God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated mee, all will bee in vain:</hi> but thou muſt prove thy election by thy converſion, as the cauſe is diſcovered by the effect. <hi>Wee muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in this where God doth end, and end where God doth begin.</hi> As on a Ladder, hee that is above, if hee would come down to you, muſt firſt uſe the top rounds, but if you would go up to him, you muſt firſt uſe the bottom-rounds, and aſcend ſtep by ſtep. Election is the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46545:160"/> uppermoſt round, ſanctification is at the bottome, and by our ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation wee muſt climbe up to ſee our names written in the Book of Life. In building men proceed <hi>methodo ſyntheticâ,</hi> in pulling down, <hi>methodo analyticâ.</hi> If you would take a Watch to peeces, you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin where the Watchmaker made an end. The Carpenter, when hee builds, firſt laies the foundation, and finiſhes the roof laſt; when hee pulls down, hee takes off the roof, and ſo to the foundation. God did firſt chuſe, and then convert us; but wee firſt know our converſion, and thereby our election. <hi>Motives to get Aſſurance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the cloze take theſe Motives drawn from the utility of this Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to quicken thee further to labour after it. This Aſſurance will bee 1. Comfortable to thy ſelf. 2. Profitable to others.</p>
               <p>It will fill thee with comfort 1. Under all Gods Providences. 2. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Gods Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That is a deſirable frame of ſpirit, that doth fit us to carry our ſelves under the various diſpenſations of divine providence (wherewith the people of God are exerciſed) as moſt becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Profeſſion wee make. Aſſurance helps us in this; For</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Aſſurance ſweetens every mercy,</hi> it is the Sugar in our Wine. Hee knows every mercy is given in mercy, and not in wrath; hee knows it is not his portion; hee hath much here, but hee is ſure hee ſhall have more hereafter; but the want of this imbitters all outward injoyments to the doubting Chriſtian; who ſaith, what are the riches of the world to mee, when I doubt whether the graces of the ſpirit are infuſed into mee? what is gold without Gods love? and what is plenty without hope of Heaven?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Aſſurance will lighten every burden;</hi> with this hee can bear the burden of adverſity (as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did the gates of <hi>Gaza</hi> upon his back, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.3.) without ſinking under it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The aſſured Beleever knows he is rich in the midſt of Poverty,</hi> Col. 2.2. Though I cannot ſay riches are mine, yet I can ſay Chriſt is mine, and that is more. Though I cannot ſay ſilver and gold is mine, yet I can ſay grace and glory is mine, and that is better. This beleever can look up towards Heaven, and ſay, yonder is the place, the palace, the Kingdome I have a title to, above yonder Heavens muſt I for ever dwell; above yonder Sun is a manſion for <hi>mee,</hi> oh I long to be there, where I know I ſhall for ever be. My heart is filled with joy, while I think on it; oh what joy ſhall enter into mee, when I ſhall enter into that joyful, bleſſed place; though now I walk in raggs, I ſhall ſhortly be cloathed with white and glorious Robes. Now a Cottage is my
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46545:161"/> houſe, but a ſtately building is prepared for mee. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2, 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The aſſured beleever rejoyceth in the ſharpeſt ſufferings for the Goſpels ſake</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 10.34. Act. 5.40, 41. &amp; 16.23, 24, 25. compare Gal. 2.20. with Act. 20.23, 24. &amp; 21.13.</note>. Hee can deſpiſe and ſcorn all the ſcornings, threatnings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the ungodly world; for though hee ſeeth hee is hated by men, yet hee knoweth hee is beloved by God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Aſſurance is the beſt cordial in time of ſickneſs, and a Soveraign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the fears of death.</hi> But it is ſad to be a doubting Chriſtian, when thou art a dying Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The aſſured beleever may with comfort approach to God in all his Ordinances. 1. Hee can go to the Throne of Grace with humble boldneſs, crying <hi>Abba</hi> Father. 2. When hee reads or hears the Word of God, every part is welcome to his ſoul. When the Promiſes are opened, hee can ſay theſe belong to mee; when threatnings are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, hee can rejoyce, becauſe hee is delivered from the miſery threatned; when commands are urged by aſſurance, they are much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitated; this is my Fathers command, I will do it, my Fathers will, I will obey it. 3. Hee can approach with joy to the Lords Supper, and ſit there with great delight. Hee ſees the wounds, the ſufferings, the ſorrows of Chriſt, and ſaith, all this was for mee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Aſſurance will make thee profitable unto others.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To the wicked.</item>
                  <item>2. To the godly.</item>

               <p n="1">1. To the wicked. By this the wicked ſhall be convinced, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a reality, that Ordinances are not empty things, when they muſt acknowledge ſurely theſe men meet with ſomething from God in duty, which wee are ſtrangers to, that maketh them thus chearful in all conditions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this they ſhall be convinced that <hi>that</hi> is falſe, they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of ſeriouſneſs in Religion, that if they cloſe with Chriſt, they ſhall never have a delightful, pleaſant life more. Drooping, diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, mourning Chriſtians, ſtrengthen this error in wicked men too much.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will make thee profitable to the godly. 1. To the weak. 2. To the ſtrong.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thou wilt be profitable to the weak, by communicating thy experiences to them for their comfort and ſupport. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thou ſhalt be profitable to the ſtrong, that have the ſame aſſurance with thy ſelf. When two ſuch meet together, oh how ſweet is their diſcourſe of the joyes of Heaven, and of the comforts of the Spirit, and the delights of the life of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Theſe advantages amongſt many others that I might have named, hath the beleever that is aſſured of his ſpiritual-ſafe-condition, that a beleever that yet knoweth it not, doth not ſo fully enjoy.

               </gap>, why its ſo, will appear in the Explication and reſolution of the ſpecial Caſe of Conſcience aſſigned: which therefore here I paſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Premiſals.</note>Before I propound the Caſe, let me premiſe ſome particulars pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory, as a Key of Explication.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the great, ſo the little World (man) is made up of Contraries: The outward-man of contrary Elements, humors, health and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; the inward-man of contrary Principles, reaſon and paſſion, Grace and Corruption, Conſcience, and Senſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Man is both an Actor in, and a Theatre of the greateſt action and nobleſt conflict in the World, though uſually inviſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſo much obſerved. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.32. He that conquers himſelf is a nobler <hi>Heroe,</hi> than <hi>Alexander</hi> who conquered a great part of the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the ſtate of Innocency there was no conflict, in the ſtate of Glory there will be no conflict, there being no corruption to combate with Grace. In a ſtate of Minority (as in Infants and Fools) there is no conflict till reaſon begin to dawn, and with it Conſcience to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate common Principles againſt the motions of innate corruption. In a ſtate of corruption there is no ſpiritual conflict, becauſe there is no renewing Grace to combate with Corruption that ſtrong man that keeps all in peace till a ſtronger than he comes. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21, 22.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The natural conflict is in every godly man, the ſpiritual conflict is in no wicked or natural man. This I note, to allay the fears of droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saints, who finding a conflict between Conſcience and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conclude they are in the ſtate of Nature, and ſearch not for the conflict between Grace and Corruption. This is, as if a man ſhould conclude he is a Beaſt, becauſe he hath ſenſe like a Beaſt, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that he hath reaſon ſuperadded, which a Beaſt is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is a vaſt difference between the natural and the ſpiritual conflict. This will appear in the reſolution of the caſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The miſtake about theſe two conflicts. 1. Undoes natural men, who feeling a Combate in themſelves, fondly apprehend it to be the fight between the fleſh and the ſpirit, and thereupon reſt ſecure in a natural eſtate. 2. It troubles regenerate perſons, and that in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence both to duty and comfort, making them drive heavily, becauſe they doubt whither they be <hi>Iſraelites</hi> or <hi>Aegiptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:46545:163"/>7. As the great Wiſdom of God lyes in Governing the Great-world made up of contraries; ſo the great wiſdom of a Godly-man lies in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Little-world made up of like contraries.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This Government lyes principally in diſcerning theſe conflicting contraries, and improving their contrariety for the Advantage of the Outward and Inward-man. He is the wiſeſt Phyſician who can Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Body made up of contraries, and he is the wiſeſt Chriſtian who can rule his Soul in the midſt of contraries, In this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Chriſt is Principal, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110.2. A Saint Inſtrumental. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.12.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This ſingular wiſdom is attainable in the uſe of ordinary means, and that by the meaneſt who have Grace to follow Chriſts conduct: yet not by the power of free-will or humane induſtry, but by the bounty of free and Special Grace. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It cannot be expected that any Unregenerate perſon ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to purpoſe the difference between theſe two conflicts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath no experience of this double State and double Principle. No wonder then if ſuch ſay of me as the <hi>Jews</hi> did of the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.49. <hi>Doth he not ſpeak Parables?</hi> How ever, for the ſake of the Unregenerate to convince them, and for the ſake of the Regenerate to comfort them, I ſhall indeavour (plowing with Chriſts Heifer) to find out this great Riddle. And ſo I come to the Caſe, and a caſe of the higheſt concernment.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
               </label> what difference is there between the conflict in the Natural and Spiritual man?</p>
            <p>They differ principally in ſeven particulars, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> and</p>
            <p n="1">I. In the ground or cauſe of the fight, which in the Unregenerate is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Natural Principles, or the reliques of Gods Image in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: The notion of a Deity, and of loving my Neighbour as my ſelf, &amp;c. are Principles cannot be raſed out of any mans heart be he never ſo profeſt an Atheiſt, nor can theſe principles lye alwayes idle, but will more or leſſe be in action againſt corrupt inclinations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Acquired Principles from common Illumination, moral and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious education and cuſtome. This light diſcovers more of ſins obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and danger, thereby laying on a ſtronger Bridle of reſtraint through fear, ſhame, &amp;c. and adding ſpurs to the exerciſe of many parts of piety.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The natural Temper of the Body which indiſpoſes to ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſins, as well as to ſome ſpecial Graces. As all Souls, ſo Original

               </gap>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:46545:165"/> corruption in them may be equal, yet not act <hi>equally,</hi> becauſe of the indiſpoſedneſſe of bodily Organs. Thus ſome naturally are more chaſt, ſober and meek then others, and hence their temper advances the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate againſt the luſts that oppoſe the forementioned virtues.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The contraiety of one luſt to another. Grace is uniforme, and each virtue linked together in a perfect ſubordination; but ſin is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and oppoſite to it ſelf as well as to Grace. Thus Ambition ſayes <hi>Spend,</hi> Covetouſneſſe ſayes <hi>Spare:</hi> Revenge incites to murder, Self-love reſtrains for fear of an halter. Here now is a combate, but only between fleſh and fleſh, between fleſh more refined and fleſh more corrupted. The beſt of theſe may be called a counter-motion (as in duſt and clouds agitated by contrary winds) but not properly a conflict or fight; becauſe they proceed not from a true vital principle, there being in a natural man no principle of Spiritual Life.</p>
            <p>On the other hand; In the Regenerate the combat ariſeth from the Antipathy of two contrary Natures perfectly hating each other, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. Of all affections (as one notes well) Love and hatred are firſt, and moſt uncompoundable. A Godly man hates ſin as God hates it, not ſo much for its danger as for its Loathſomneſſe; as ſome creatures hate filth ſo that they will rather dye then defile themſelves. One Wolf may ſnarl at another, but the quarrel is not layd in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as it is in the Wolf and Lamb, which therefore cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. God in Paradiſe firſt ſounded the Trumpet to this All-arme, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. proclaiming an eternal Warr between this ſeed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and of the Serpent. As in perſons, ſo much more in principles, there is a mutual abomination. Compare <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.22. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.10. and 119.128. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. Enemies may, but Enmity can never be reconciled.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They differ in the Object or matter of conflict; which in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man is, 1. Groſſer evils that ſtartle the Conſcience. 2. Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous evils that are attended with worldly fear or ſhame, or 3. Some particular evils that croſſe temper, education or cuſtome, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But in ſpiritual perſons, the matter of conflict is, 1. Little ſins as well as great, 2. Secret ſins as well as open. 3. The firſt riſings as well as the groſſe acts. 4. Sins which promiſe worldly ſafety, credit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, contentment, as well as thoſe ſins that threaten the contrary. 5. In a word, all moral evil; hatred and Antipathy being of the whole kind, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.128. eſpecially of thoſe evils which moſt indanger the New-man, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18.23. and ſuch as are beloved ſins, <hi>Matth:</hi> 18. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:46545:165"/>III. They differ in the ſubject of the conflict. In natural men the fight is in ſeveral faculties, reaſon fighting againſt ſenſe and paſſion, or the dictate of conſcience againſt the corrupt inclination of the will; whence the fight is more at a diſtance by miſſile Arms and velitation. But in the regenerate man the fight is more cloſe in the ſame faculty, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of fleſh and ſpirit counteracting in the ſame underſtanding, the luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the fleſh and ſpirit in the ſame will: whence the fight is as it were <hi>inter Triarios</hi> Grace and Corruption immediatly; which at firſt haply was managed by the <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Scutati,</hi> Reaſon and Intereſt. The former is like the fight of the Souldiers of Fortune, more lazy and by way of Siege; the latter more keen and vigorous by way of Aſſault an Onſlait; like that of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who fought with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies breaſt to breaſt in a Box or Grate.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. They differ in the Inſtruments or weapons wherewith they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. The natural mans weapons are (like himſelf) carnal; to wit, natural or moral reaſon, worldly fears or hopes, and ſometimes ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fears or hopes but carnalized, namely ſlaviſh fear and mercenary hopes. But the Regenerate mans weapons are Spiritual, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. to wit, gracious Intereſt, and all the Spiritual Armour, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. — 18. eſpecially the Shield of Faith, and the Sword of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="5">V. They differ in the manner of the fight. The natural mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is more mercenary; admits of more Parley's, ceſſations, correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, as 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Sauls</hi> fight with <hi>Amaleck.</hi> But the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man (as ſuch) fights it out to the laſt, and will give no Quarter. The former is like the ſtrife between Wind and Tide, which often come about and are both of one ſide; the latter is like the Dam and the Tide, that ſtrive till one be born down: or like Stream and Tide meeting and conflicting till one hath overborn the other.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. They differ in the extent of the conflict, in relation to its ſubject and duration. The extent of the Subject is double. 1. As to the faculties. 2. As to the Acts. As to the faculties; The ſeat of Warr in the Regenerate is every faculty, fleſh and ſpirit being ever mixed (as light and darkneſſe in every poynt of Ayr in the twilight) 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. Grace and Corruption Leaven the whole-man: So that in the Regenerate there is at the ſame time both a Civil and a Forein Warr, that in the ſame faculty, this in one faculty againſt another.</p>
            <p>Contrariwiſe, in the Unregenerate there is uſually nothing but a forein War between ſeveral faculties, there being nothing of ſpiritual good in their wills and affections, to ſet the ſame faculty againſt it ſelf.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46545:166"/> 2. It extends alſo to every act of piety, and charity (eſpecially if more ſpiritual) <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. For which the natural man hath no conflict, (but againſt them) unleſſe it be to ſtop the mouth of conſcience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned &amp;c. Nor indeed doth he know experimentally what ſpiritual acts of Piety are. But the regenerate find it by conſtant experience, Faith and Unbelief, Humility and Pride ever oppoſing and counter-working each other: whence he is forced to cut his way through his Enemies, and to diſpute it ſtep by ſtep. Others may ſeek, but he ſtrives, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. and takes the Kingdom of Heaven by an holy violence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12. in ſpight of ſpiritual Enemies that way-lay him within and without.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the extent of Duration of the Warr, which being in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate irreconcileable muſt needs be interminable; like the Warr between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> that was intayl'd to Poſterity: or as fire and water will fight for ever if together for ever. In the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man (contrariwiſe) the quarrel is ſoon took up, as between the <hi>Romans</hi> and other Nations; there being not that Antipathy between Reaſon and Corruption, as there is between Grace and Corruption.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. They differ in the concomitants and conſequents of the fight. And 1. The fight in natural men may ſtand with the conſtant practice of and living in ſin againſt the light of Conſcience. Godly men ſin more with knowledge, but wicked men more againſt knowledge. He that is born of God doth not commit ſin, that is, make a trade of living and lying in known ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The fight in the Unregenerate hinders not the perfection and conſummation of ſin in the antecedent deliberation and purpoſe, in the preſent delight and complacency, and the following pertinacy and impenitency. Inſtance in <hi>Saul, Herod, Judas,</hi> and others. But the Spirit by its conflict breaks the power of ſin in all theſe in the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, that they can neither do good as they would, nor ſin as they otherwiſe would, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The fight in natural men ſeeks only the repreſſion, not the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſin, to lop the ſuperfluous branches, not ſtub up the root; to charm the Serpent, not to break its head. But the ſpiritual fight ſeeks the full mortification and abolition of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. (hatred ſeeks the deſtruction of its Enemie, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.19. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15.) and the compleat perfection of Grace, though not attainable in this life. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. — 14. This for the firſt branch of Wiſdom, which teaches to diſcern between the natural and the ſpiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict.</p>
            <pb n="331" facs="tcp:46545:166"/>
            <p>The ſecond Branch of Heavenly Wiſdom,<note place="margin">Aplic.</note> lyes in improving theſe Spiritual Contrarieties, by ſiding with the ſpirit againſt the fleſh.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is done. 1. By watching all the forces, deſigns and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Enemy. We have in us Legions of theſe Devils, the meaneſt of them too ſtrong and too ſubtil for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. true <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> that can eaſily cheat us with their mouldy bread, and clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Garments; Sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> all of one confederacy, and ſworn Enemies of our Salvation; had we not need have our eyes in our heads, and ſet watchfulneſſe upon the forelorn hope? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By making head early againſt the Enemy. <hi>Principiis obſta, &amp;c.</hi> nip ſin in the bud, cruſh this Cockatrice in the ſhell, ſtrangle this hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-Brat in the birth; take heed of the firſt appearances of evill, take it's firſt All-armes; ſlight not the ſmalleſt ſin or occaſion of ſinning. How much miſchife is done by a little wound, a little Thief, a ſmal Spark? <hi>James</hi> 3.5. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Oppoſe eſpecially thy Maſter-Luſt. Fight (in compariſon) neither againſt ſmall nor great, but againſt the King of theſe Helliſh Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.31. Be ſure to pull out that right eye. This is the Skirt Satan layes hold of, in wraſtling with thee, to thy hazzard, and his no ſmall advantage; The <hi>Goliah</hi> and <hi>Holophernes,</hi> who being once ſlain, the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> will ſoon be routed. Throw the head of this <hi>Shebah</hi> over the wall, and the enemy will retreat ſhamefully.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Never enter the field without thy Second: Fight under the Shield as well as under the Banner of thy General. In other fights the General flyes to the Battel upon the wings of his Army, but here the Army flyes upon the wings of their General. This is done by Faith and Prayer. Thus <hi>David</hi> conque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.45. and the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.19, 23. Fight alwayes upon thy knees; Let <hi>Moſes</hi> be praying while <hi>Joſuah</hi> is fighting, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. Put on, keep on, ſtand in, and exerciſe thy Spiritual Arms, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 10. — 18. That only is Armour of Proof: never any girds it on but may boaſt before the Victory. Allude to 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.11. never any fought proſperouſly without it: It's our mettal as well as our weapon. Neither Earth, nor Hell can ſtand againſt this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of Heaven. Let not Satan find thee diſarmed, leſt he leave thee diſpoyled. There is no fighting with carnal weapons againſt a ſpiritual
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46545:167"/> Enemy. You may as well beat the Devil with a ſword or ſpear, as conquer ſin by the power of Free-will, or with moral and worldly Arguments. They are but paper bullets and paper walls, the ſcorn, not the Terrour of Hell, though uſeful in ſome caſes. Remember withal, there are no Arms for thy Back-parts.</p>
            <p n="6">6. With ſome Luſts fight like the <hi>Parthians,</hi> flying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. This is but an honourable retreat, and warlike ſtratagem, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.32.

            <p>The Subject I am to ſpeak to, is to ſhow what is meant here by asking <hi>in Faith,</hi> or what Faith that is, which who ſo hath not, muſt not, or hath no reaſon to expect to receive any thing from God. God may beſtow his mercies where and on whom he pleaſeth; but is no way engaged by promiſe to beſtow any mercy on ſuch an one that asketh not in Faith. It is not ſaid, that ſuch an one ſhould not expect any great matters from God, but not any thing at all, the leaſt mercy is greater, then he hath any reaſon to think he ſhall receive, not only he ſhall not receive Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſpoken of <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. but not any thing. Wiſdom he may get as <hi>Achitophel</hi> did, and many other things without praying in Faith, or praying at all, but for Divine Wiſdom or for any bleſſing from God, he may think what he will, but if the Apoſtle may be thought worthy to adviſe him, he would not have him think to receive any thing, except he ask, and ask in Faith. Therefore it much concerns us to know what is meant by asking in Faith, ſince the want of it makes our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of none effect; if we pray without it, we may pray but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly expect any return of your Prayers, except it be as of an arrow

            <p>Some may make it to imply more to ask <hi>in</hi> Faith then to ask <hi>with</hi> Faith, or that it is more to be <hi>in Faith,</hi> then for <hi>Faith</hi> to be <hi>in us.</hi> To be <hi>in</hi> Love is more then <hi>to</hi> love, and when it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.10. that the Apoſtle was <hi>in</hi> the Spirit, it ſhowes that not only he <hi>had</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and was <hi>filled</hi> with it, but there were great overflowings, and a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundance of the Spirit. This the Apoſtle ſeems to call, <hi>James</hi> 5.15. the Prayer <hi>of</hi> Faith, as if their <hi>Faith</hi> rather prayed then <hi>they,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>It is not I, but the Grace of God in me,</hi> when Faith ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be ſaid to act <hi>us</hi> then we to act <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe thoſe high degrees of Faith cannot be meant here, becauſe it is ſaid, that they who have not this Faith, muſt not think to receive any thing, not the leaſt; if ſo then the higheſt degrees of Faith ſhould be required for the obtaining the loweſt degrees of Mercy; but Scripture promiſes are made to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and not to the <hi>degrees</hi> of Grace. To Faith that is but as a graine of Muſtard-ſeed to remove Mountains, and to Love that is but a ſpark to be victorious, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20. but I ſhall rather endeavour to ſhew you how Faith is taken here, then how 'tis taken in other places, therefore, <hi>To ask in Faith,</hi> may he here ſpoken in reference to the Perſon that prayes, <hi>viz.</hi> he that prayes muſt be in the Faith a faithful or Righteous Perſon. The Scripture is full to this purpoſe, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>If I regard iniquity in mine heart,</hi> though my tongue do not plead for it, nay though it ſpeaks againſt it, though I refrain from it in my Life; for one may love the ſin we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not, and if I do ſo regard it in mine heart God will not hear my Prayers: if I give it ſo much as a good look, for ſo the <hi>Hebrew, if I ſee iniquity in my heart,</hi> if I take any pleaſure in ſin, for <hi>David</hi> calls it <hi>painful iniquity,</hi> for ſo in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> No Saint can live without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſin, but all Saints live without regarding it in their hearts. So alſo <hi>James</hi> 5.15. <hi>The Prayer of a Righteous man avayleth much,</hi> how much is not ſet down, becauſe it cannot be ſet down <hi>how much</hi> it avayles as <hi>much</hi> as they <hi>pleaſe,</hi> they may have what they <hi>will;</hi> but for a wicked man though his Prayers were effectual they avail not much, ſince their deſires are for temporals. The other places are full to this point, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Prayers of none but Righteous perſons are accepted with God, as <hi>John</hi> 9.31. <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:46545:169"/>I. To this may be objected, that many unregenerate and profligate wretches have obtained by Prayer, as ſcoffing <hi>Iſmael, Gen.</hi> 21.17. nay <hi>Ahab,</hi> a man that ſold himſelf to work wickedneſſe, prevayled with God, for an adjournment of the Judgment denounced.</p>
            <p>I anſwer 1. This was done by way of Common providence, or Gods Prerogative, not by way of promiſe, ſo that they could not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect that their Prayer ſhould be heard.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God did this to honour the Ordinance of Prayer. As when our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren come and tell us of ſome poor body, though we may not think it ſit to relieve him in reſpect of his wants, yet we give him, for fear we ſhould hinder our children from acts of Charity; for they not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our reaſons of denying him relief, will expound it to be our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the poor. So many times God may give to bad men, leſt good men ſhould be diſcouraged from Prayer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God gives to wicked men when they pray, oft-times for the ſtrengthning of his peoples Faith; for they may be ſure if God hears the Croakings of Ravens, he will heare the Mournings of Doves.</p>
            <p n="2">II. You may farther ſay, are wicked men bound to pray, ſince their Prayes are anabomination, and they cannot ask in Faith?</p>
            <p>I anſwer. 1. Inability to pay a debt, doth not acquit one from it, nor Cancel the Obligation. If one blows out the Candle, one cannot excuſe ones ſelf for not working, by ſaying that they could not work in the dark; nor can a boy excuſe himſelf from ſaying the Leſſon he hath torn out of his Book.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe wicked men break others of Gods Commandments, it cannot juſtifie them in the breaking of this, ſin doth ſuper-induce a new Obligation, <hi>viz.</hi> to puniſhment, but doth not cancel their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>viz.</hi> to Duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wicked men ſin not in praying, but in praying ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Doubtleſſe the wickedeſt man in the World is bound to deſire Grace.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But doth not this make God a reſpecter of perſons, ſince he will hear none but his own Children, and them that love him; if a Judge ſhould favour his relations in Judicature, be ſhould be unjuſt.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer No, God is no reſpecter of perſons, by doing thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Prayers of Saints are better, as well as their perſons nearer, for the Prayers of the wicked are lazy, irreverent, bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. If Unbelievers could pray better than Saints, yet God might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46545:169"/> the Saint and condemn the Unbeliever, as a Judge may paſſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt one who hath paid ninty and nine pounds of an hundred, and acquit another who hath not paid a farthing, if his ſurety hath paid it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though in matter of Juſtice we are not to reſpect perſons, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.15. yet in matters of favour we may, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. This may be the firſt meaning of the words, but not the only, nor as I conceive the chief. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>To ask in Faith,</hi> is, to believe, that <hi>all</hi> we ſay in Prayer is <hi>true,</hi> when we confeſſe our ſelves to be grievous ſinners, we are to think our ſelves to be as great ſinners as we ſay we are; when we call God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty our Father, we are to believe him to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Then the poor Soul will ſay, Alas I cannot pray in Faith, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay our <hi>Father,</hi> ſince I do not believe that I am his child, how then can I call him <hi>Father?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer 1. Thou mayſt call him <hi>Father,</hi> for he is thy <hi>Father;</hi> if thou ſhouldeſt ſee diverſe children playing ſome untowardneſſe in the ſtreet, and ſhould ſee a man that paſſed by, go and ſingle out one of them, and correct him and yet the child ſhould follow him, would you not ſay he was the father of that child; for a ſtrange child would flye <hi>from him,</hi> or flye <hi>at</hi> him if he ſhould ſtrike him. Doſt thou not follow God when he corrects thee? be of good comfort, God is thy Father, and thou art his child.</p>
            <p>When that pretious man Mr. <hi>Murcot</hi> was in great anguiſh, fearing tht God was not his Father, theſe words were impreſſed on his mind, <hi>If I am not thy Father, why doſt thou follow after me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay not only God <hi>is</hi> thy Father, but thou <hi>thinkeſt</hi> ſo alſo. When <hi>Naamans</hi> ſervants called him father, what did they mean, but to ſhew that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er. When the Prodigal returned, though he acknowledged that he was not worthy to be called his ſon, yet he called him Father, ſince he had fayled of nothing that might be expected from a loving tender Father. Mayſt thou not call God thy Father upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> this account, hath he not dealt with thee in abundance of tender Compaſſion, nay more than the tendereſt Parent in the World. Give God the glory due to his goodneſſe, call him Father, for thou mayſt truly ſay he hath dealt ſo with thee. The ſame Mr. <hi>Murcot</hi> being troubled upon the ſame account, <hi>viz.</hi> the fear that God was not his Father, had theſe words come into his mind, with power, <hi>viz. If I am not thy Father, am I thy Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?</hi> God argues thus with the <hi>Jews,</hi> Deut. 32.6.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:46545:170"/>III. We are to believe, that whatſoever we ask of God in Prayer is according to his will, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14.</p>
            <p>The poor doubting Soul will ſay then, I dare not pray for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of my child, ſince I know not whether it be the will of God it ſhall recover or no.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Thine asking what God hath decreed not to give, makes not thy Prayer ſinful, but thine asking what he hath forbid thee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; for the will of Gods Decree is not the rule for us to walk by, but the will of his Command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. If what we pray for be ſuch as is lawful and good for us to deſire, though God ſhould tell us by a Prophet that he would not grant it, yet we might lawfully pray for it, and be blameleſſe, for ſo did <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. nay though God ſhould ſend us word by a Prophet that we ſhould dye and not live, yet we might pray, and not only be blameleſſe but ſucceſsful, for ſo was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> nay though God ſhould forbid us to pray, yet ſince he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to pray in his Word, we may pray, and be heard; for though God bid <hi>Jacob</hi> let him go, yet he wreſtled on and obtained the bleſſing: and <hi>Moſes,</hi> though God bid him let him alone, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> did not let him alone and prevailed. So then to ask things according to the will of God, is to ask nothing that is unlawful to ask, as for one to pray that God would proſper us in evil wayes, this is to ask what is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will. I ſay, you are to pray for no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing that is any way unlawful to be deſired. Now it is not enough that the thing it ſelf be lawful to be deſired, but the end for which we deſire it muſt be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for if we deſire lawful things for unlawful ends, we ask amiſſe, <hi>James</hi> 4.3. The end why we deſire ſuch a mercy muſt be ſuch, as God approves of by his Word, as well as the thing it ſelf. To deſire gifts of Edification for oſtentation, though according to the Will of God as to the thing deſired, yet as to the end it is abhominable.</p>
            <p>As concerning the matter of our Prayers, we are to believe, as hath been ſaid, ſo as to God we are to believe ſeveral things. Indeed ſcarce any of his Attributes but ſome way or other we are to act our Faith upon in Prayer, but I ſhall chooſe ſome few on which the eye of Faith is eſpecially fixed in Prayer.</p>
            <p>The firſt is Gods <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> for elſe we ſhall be at a great loſſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. If we believe not this, how can we be aſſured that God hears our Prayers.</p>
            <p>For 1. In reſpect of the number of Prayers, there being Millions of Prayers put up at the ſame time to God, if he be not Omniſcient
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46545:170"/> how is it poſſible he ſhould hear all, if any ſhould not be heard, how knoweſt thou that thine is not the Prayer that is not heard.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the Secrecy of Prayer; for except God know our hearts he cannot know our prayers, for it is the heart that prayes, the tongue only ſpeaks, <hi>Orat mens, lingua loquitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If God knew not the heart, the poor ſoul who pray'd with ſighs and groans that cannot be expreſſed ſhould find no acceptance, when the hypocrite that ſpeaks much and means nothing, ſhall be heard for his much babling.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Saints ask ſuch things that require infinite Knowledge and Wiſdom to do for us; for when we deſire God to make us to know him, it requires more wiſdom than for us to teach an Infant the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. So we deſire God to cure us of our ſpiritual diſtempers, alas they are ſo various, ſo contrary, ſo deeply rooted in our Natures, we are ſuch froward unruly Patients, that it requires infinite Wiſdom to heal us; for when God goes to cure our Pride by afflicting us, then our impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is increaſed: That which is the cure of one corruption increaſeth another.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If we believe not Gods Wiſdom and Omniſcience we cannot acquieſce in Gods anſwer of Prayers, for we may <hi>ſuffer</hi> but not <hi>acquieſce</hi> in Gods anſwer of Prayers.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We are to believe Gods <hi>Providence</hi> that he rules and orders all things. Whoſo thinks that all things are ruled by ſecond Cauſes, by the Power and Policy of men, or by the Stars or chance, they will not Pray at all, or go to God meerly as a refuge: We ſhall pray to God, but truſt to our ſelves, or to medecines when we are ſick, and to our food when we are well. We may be confident we ſhall be delivered, but we ſhall not at all truſt that God will deliver us. To ſtrengthen our Faith in this we muſt know, That thoſe things that ſeem to be leaſt within the compaſs of Providence, are wholly guided by it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Things Natural; God makes the Sun to ariſe, and the Rain to fall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Gives to every ſeed his own body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſmalleſt things they eſcape not Providence; God numbers the hairs of our head, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.30.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Things caſual, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.33. That which we call Chance medley, is providential as to God: The man 1 <hi>Kings</hi> drew a Bow <hi>at a venture,</hi> and yet God directed it to an hairs breadth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Counſels of men, yea againſt God, yet are ordered by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Counſel of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Things moſt unruly; The raging Sea goes ſo farre and no further
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46545:171"/> by Gods decree: the roaring Lion cannot deſtroy a Swine, not afflict nor tempt a Saint, without Gods leave, <hi>Job</hi> 1. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. The wrath of man as well as the rage of the devil, is ordered and reſtrained by the Wiſdom and Power of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The skill and inventions of men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.27, 28.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Sin it ſelf, whether of Omiſſion or Commiſſion, as ſilence and diſcord in Muſick, ſerves to make the Harmony ſweeter.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Gods <hi>Omnipotence</hi> is to be believed, elſe we will ſtagger through unbelief. This was that in which the eminency of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith did appear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. and of the Centurion's, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. and Chriſt farre more blames them that queſtion his <hi>Can</hi> than his <hi>Will,</hi> for he doth not ſo much as reprove the Leper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. but ſo ſharply reproves him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. hat he makes him weep, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>If thou canſt,</hi> &amp; he ſaith, <hi>If thou canſt believe,</hi> to ſhow that we cannot believe if we do not believe Gods Power. We doubtleſs are generally faulty this way, though we are aſhamed to own it, as you may ſee by this inſtance. If we have two children ſick, the one whoſe death would be farre more afflictive to us, hath ſome cold or ſome other ſmall diſtemper, the other of ſome mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſeaſe, and given up by Phyſitians; thou prayeſt for the recovery of both, but for which of thoſe two recovery art thou leaſt confident, is it not of his who is moſt ſick? and why ſo? but becauſe thou queſtioneſt Gods Power or Providence: If thou ſhalt ſay my ſins are ſo great God will not hear my prayers and heal my child, for if indeed that were the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thy fearing that God will not hear thee, thou wouldſt rather fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r it as to thine other child, ſince his death would be more afflictive.</p>
            <p>Now the Saints have more reaſon to ſtrengthen their Faith in the Omnipotence of God in Prayer than wicked men, for becauſe the things worldly men deſire need not Omnipotence to do: A creature may do what they deſire, except God will withdraw his common Providence, for one that is worth an hundred thouſand pounds can make a poor man rich; and ſome Medicines in an ordinary way of Providence have vertue to cure many Diſeaſes: But the things the people of God deſire cannot be done but by Omnipotence, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. We muſt act our Faith upon his <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>Bounty,</hi> for we muſt not only have high thoughts of Gods other Excellencies, but of his Goodneſs alſo, of his abundant willingneſs to do us good, and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to afflict us, for ſurely he never afflicts us but in caſe of neceſſity, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>If need be you are in many tribulations.</hi> When he afflicts us he only gives us <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> but when he beſtows mercies, he gives us not only for our neceſſity, but <hi>richly to enjoy.</hi> When we go to a Covetous
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46545:171"/> man for mony, he parts with every penny as with a drop of bloud; for us to think God parts ſo with his Mercies, that he is hard to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that he is an hard Maſter either for <hi>work</hi> or <hi>wages,</hi> are thoughts utterly unworthy, and ſhamefully diſhonourable to the Goodneſſe of God. If thy child, whoſe finger if it ſhould but ake, thine heart akes, ſhould think thou grudgeſt him every bit of meat he eats, thou wouldſt think him a wretched child unworthy of thy tender affections; and muſt it not be farre worſe in thee to have ſuch thoughts of God? ſince <hi>tam pius nemo, tam pater nemo.</hi> Was it ſo great a grief to <hi>Peter</hi> to have Chriſt queſtion his love? <hi>John</hi> 21.17. though he had given but ſad te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his Love but lately; and can it chooſe but much offend God for thee to queſtion Gods Love to thee, nay his Goodneſs in it ſelf, when God hath given thee no cauſe of either, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.1. We ſhould go to God with as much confidence of his Love, and readineſs to do us good, as the child doth to the tendereſt Parent, as we do to the deareſt friend we have in the whole world, and much more abundantly: If we do not believe that the goodneſs of God is as much above the goodneſs and love of our deareſt friend, as we account his Wiſdom and Power above our friends, we have unworthy thoughts of that Attribute which God hath moſt abundantly manifeſted, and would have moſt glorified; and the love our friend bears us is but a drop from and of that Ocean that is in God. Doubtleſs God loves his enemies more then we love our friends; he loves us more (if we love him) then we love our ſelves or him. Surely God loves the weakeſt Saint on earth more than the higheſt Angel in heaven loves him; for when God ſaith that he <hi>So lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the world,</hi> it was ſuch a <hi>Sic</hi> there was no <hi>Sicut</hi> for it, it might not be ſaid as the Angels loved God. Ah we deal unworthily with God in having baſe low thoughts of his goodneſs, he hath little deſerved it at our hands, he that hath done ſuch wonders and miracles of Mercies for us, and hath promiſed to do more; Say that every mercy is too great for thee to receive, but ſay not that any is too great for God to give: Surely, ſurely God is more willing to give, than we are to receive mercies.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, <hi>If God be ſo willing to beſtow mercies, why doth he not beſtow them without prayers, and ſuch importunity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, God doth not thus becauſe he is not willing, but becauſe we are not fit for Mercies, for God <hi>waits to be gracious:</hi> The tender Mother had rather give her child Cordials than bitter Pils, but her child is ſick: By our Prayers we make not God more willing, but we become more prepared for Mercies, for our Prayers exerciſe, and ſo ſtrengthen grace, and ſtrong grace weakens and mortifies corruption, and then we are fit
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:46545:172"/> for mercies. God only ſtayes while he may bleſſe us indeed, as <hi>Jabez</hi> phraſeth it. One that is in a Boat and pulls a Rope whoſe other end is tied to a Rock, pulls not the Rock to the Boat but the Boat to the Rock; ſo our Importunities move not God but us.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, when we pray for others this reaſon holds not, for their graces are not encreaſed by our praying for their deliverances from miſery or danger, or the Church from perſecution.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer. It is true, but our Prayers add to our reward, for God is in goodneſſe as Sathan is in badneſſe, and much more abundantly; whereas wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Sathan hath a Commiſſion and intends to do ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, he as oft as he can engageth Witches to put him upon doing that which he intends to do, howſoeve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that he may involve them in the guilt, as if they themſelves or that he had not done it if they had not put him upon it. So God that the Saints may have the reward of the good he doth to others, as if they themſelves had done it, or as if God would not have done it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hout their Prayers, puts them upon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thoſe Mercies for others, which he will do howſoever, <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.16.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Third Object of Faith are the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and there are three kinds, ſome <hi>to</hi> Prayer, ſome <hi>of</hi> Prayer, ſome to the <hi>Perſon</hi> praying. We are to act our Faith upon all, but for brevity ſake (for I am forced to Contract) I ſhall anſwer but one Objection.</p>
            <p>The poor Soul will ſay, I do not believe I have any Intereſt in the promiſes, therefore I cannot pray in Faith. I Anſwer.</p>
            <p>To obtain the Mercies included in a promiſe, it is not requried that we ſhould believe our Intereſt in it but the truth, not that God will perform to us but to thoſe to whom it belongs, though you do not believe it belongs to you, for the promiſes made to Graces, are made to them that have them, not to them that believe; as for example, the promiſes made to Faith are made to them that have Faith though they believe not that they do believe, and that poor Souls doubt that God will never make good any promiſe to them, proceeds not from any doubt of Gods veracity or faithfulneſſe, but of their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe and non-intereſt in them.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The fourth and main Object of Faith which our Faith muſt eye in our Prayers is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whom all the Promiſes are yea and Amen, who hath reconciled the Perſon and Attributes of God, and concerning Chriſt we are to believe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The great love God bears to Chriſt, which is doubtleſſe greater then to the whole Creation, for to which of the Angels ſaid he at any time,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:46545:172"/> 
               <hi>Thou art my beloved in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Gods Love to Chriſt is not only greater, but diffuſive, for the Love that God bears to Chriſt is as the oyl that was poured upon the head of <hi>Aaron</hi> which ran down to the skirts of his garments; ſo the Love that God bears to Chriſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates not in the Perſon of Chriſt, but is communicated to all that are his. As <hi>Haman</hi> to ſhew the great hatred he bore to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> would not bound his malice on the perſon of <hi>Mordecai;</hi> but would deſtroy the whole Nation; So God thought it too ſmall a Teſtimony of his Love to Chriſt to be well pleaſed with Chriſt (for ſo he is with the Angels) but he is well pleaſed in Chriſt with the whole World, I mean all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We muſt believe this, or we cannot expect any favour for his ſake. His Love to Chriſt is ſo great, that his Love to Chriſt is greater then his hatred to ſinners; ſo that any ſinner may be reconciled and accepted, through Chriſt. God came to reconcile God and ſinners, not God and ſin. As one who deſires the King to be reconciled to ſuch a Traytour, doth not deſire him to be reconciled to the Treaſon, but to the Traytour.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We are to believe the fulneſſe of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, and the greatneſſe of the value and efficacy of the death of Chriſt; for if Juſtice be not ſatisfied, we have no Throne of Grace, but a ſeat and Barr of Juſtice to come before. The Blood of Chriſt hath a pacifying, purifying, purchaſing, perfuming, reconciling, ſatisfying, juſtifying virtue. It pacifies Gods wrath, it reconciles and juſtifies our perſons, it purifies our Nature, it perfumes our duties, it purchaſeth our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>
            <p n="3">III. We are to believe the efficacy and infallible ſucceſſe of Chriſts Interceſſion. The fulneſſe of Chriſts Interceſſion is in this, that he doth three things for us, all that we ſtand in need of, according to what was Typified by the High-Prieſt, for he did three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſprinkled the blood upon the Mercy-ſeat, hereby an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made as to our ſins, they being pardoned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He went in with Incenſe, hereby our duties were perfumed; ſo God is ſaid to inhabit the Praiſes of his People, and to dwell in thick darkneſſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the the thick ſmoke of the Incenſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He had the Names of the Tribes engraven on his breaſt or heart. Chriſt pleads the love he bears to his People. Three places the names of the Saints are written in, out of either whereof nor men nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils can blot them out, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Book of Life, on the palms of his hands, and on the heart of Chriſt. I may add the fourth thing the High-Prieſt did when he entered into the Holy Place, <hi>viz.</hi> he went in
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46545:173"/> with all his rich Prieſtly Garments, to ſhew we ſhould be clothed with the rich Robes of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, for what the High-Prieſt did, he did not in his perſonal but in his publick capacity. Now the efficacy of his Interceſſion was not only from the wonderful Love God bore to Chriſt, from the unparalleld Intereſt Chriſt had in the Father, by theſe means we may expect all acts of favour, but we have Juſtice on our ſide, for favour is an arbitrary thing, therefore Chriſt is our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1.2. he preſents our caſe not by way of Petition, but by way of pleading; for Advocates do not petition but plead.</p>
            <p>So then Chriſt doth four things as to our Prayers. 1. He endites them by his Spirit, he perfumes them by his merit, then he preſents our Prayers and Perſons, for we have acceſſe through him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. and then ſuperadds his own Interceſſion, his blood crying louder then our ſins, and better things then our Prayers.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. We are to believe and improve this truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exceedingly delights to honour Chriſt, and hereby God wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully honours Chriſt by pardoning, and receiving into favour ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſinners as we are for his ſake, by forgiving, any thing for his ſake. A ſinner cannot pleaſe God better, then by coming with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence for pardon for his ſake. If we come for pardon or mercies, and our Confidence ariſeth from our low thoughts of the number or ſinfulneſſe of our ſins, or of Gods hatred of ſin, or our ability to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Juſtice or deſerve Mercy; our Confidence is deſperate impudence and arrogance, but if purely from the high eſteem we have of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſibleneſſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and of Chriſts Intereſt in Gods Love, and of the Fathers delight to honour Chriſt; ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fince is pretious and acceptable with God, and whoſoever hath it, may go with as much freedom and aſſurance of favour, as if he had never ſinned, with as much as <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency, or the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Glory. Alas we do not believe or not improve theſe truths, for if we did, we might have any thing, for Chriſt hath Intereſt enough in God to bear us out, and procure any Mercy.</p>
            <p n="5">V. We are to believe improve and obey Chriſts Command, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 14.13, 14, 16, 23. the former truths give us great hope, but this ſtrong Conſolation, for though ſuch a great Perſon had never ſo much intereſt in ſome other great Perſon, with whom we had to do, yet without a Commiſſion from him we might not go in his Name, but Chriſt hath not only given us leave but a Command, and now it is not an arbitrary thing, we may do or not do, but we muſt do. This is the Incomprehenſible goodneſſe of God, that what is for our good he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46545:173"/> us, that not only we may be put on the more to obtain what is good for us, but that it may be an act of obedience, and ſo we may be rewarded for procuring our own happineſſe.</p>
            <p>So much for the things we are to believe, now for the manner of believing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to believe theſe things of God and Chriſt with an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With a Faith of Recumbency we are to rely upon the Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, and upon Chriſts Intereſt in God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Saints are by way of duty but not by way of a neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obtaining whatſoever they ask, to believe with the Faith of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of obtaining whatſoever we pray for. By Faith here in the Text is not meant, that we muſt without any doubt or w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vering believe, that we ſhall receive in kind whatſoever we ask, even the very thing we pray for.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Leper was cured though he prayed with an <hi>if thou wilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe in diſertion ſhould put up no acceptable Prayers, ſince they have not Faith of aſſurance of obtaining.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt when he comes at the day of Judgment, he ſhall not find this Faith on the Earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.8. and yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. it is ſaid, God will hear thoſe Prayers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle forbids this Faith <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. therefore it is not the Faith here commanded, for then it ſhould run thus, you muſt believe you ſhall receive the thing you ask for, but if you do not you muſt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; many more arguments may be brought to prove this, but theſe ſhall ſuffice, beſides what ſhall be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id in the Poſitive handling this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>viz. What Faith is required as to our believing abſolutely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, in kind the very thing we ask,</hi> which I ſhall Anſwer in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. When we ask Temporal bleſſings as we ought, we are bound to believe we ſhall receive them as we ask them; for our Prayers for Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things ſhould be ſpiritual as to the end, and moderate as to their meaſure, and conditional as to their effect upon us, <hi>i. e.</hi> if it be for our good. now ſince our deſires are to be Conditional, and Gods Promiſes of Temporals are Conditional, we muſt not abſolutely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we ſhall receive what we ask: a Conditional promiſe cannot be a foundation for an abſolute Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Our Faith and Confidence of obtaining the thing we ask, ſhould proceed <hi>pari paſſu</hi> ſhould be as ſtrong to the event as it is to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. If we are very confident what we ask is for the glory of God
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46545:174"/> or our good, we muſt be as Confident that we ſhall have it; for as we are to put no Condition to abſolute Promiſes ſince God hath put none, ſo we are to add no more Conditions to Conditional Promiſes than God hath put, and upon thoſe Conditions we are as fully to rely upon Gods performance, as upon his performance of abſolute Promiſes.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Though we cannot nor ought not certainly to believe the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing we ask, if it be Temporal by virtue of the Promiſe, yet by virtue of an immediate aſſurance God may give us of receiving the very thing we ask, we may and indeed cannot chuſe but expect it. We read of Gods dealings ſo with ſeveral of his Saints (with Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> and many others.)</p>
            <p n="4">IV. As for Spiritual bleſſings they are of four ſorts. 1. Of Edification as gifts, ſuch as ſpeaking with Tongues, and Propheſying in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, and the gifts of Preaching and Praying now, or</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of Conſolation as aſſurance, and the Comforts of the Spirit, the Priviledges of the Kingdom of God, as Peace, and Joy, in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of Sanctification, as Grace and Glory, for the former the ſame rules as belong to Temporals belong to theſe, but for Saving Grace, as our Prayers ought not to be Conditional, ſince we are ſure it is for our good, and the glory of God for us to be holy; ſo our Faith ought not to be conditional but abſolute and particular, that God will give us Grace and Glory, if we ſincerely and fervently ask it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yet though I ſhould believe that God certainly will give Grace, nay and all other things, if good for me, yet my not believing that God will give me Grace, doth not null mine intereſt in the Promiſe, but only my Comfort, nor ſhall it hinder Gods performance, though it hinders our expectation of receiving.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Though we are not abſolutely to believe we ſhall receive Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſings or thoſe of conſolation or edification, yet that we do not more confidently expect the performance of ſuch Prayers in kind, proceeds generally from our not believing and improving the Power and goodneſſe of God, and the great Intereſt Chriſt hath in God, and the reſt that I have ſpoken of, for generally we are more confident that the thing we pray for is good for us, then we are that we ſhall have it.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. We may be as confident that the reſtoring of our ſelves or our relations to health, or deliverance of them out of danger is for our good, as they in our Saviours time, who prayed to him for theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, were.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:46545:174"/>VII. As the caſe ſtands between Juſtifying Faith and aſſurance, ſo the caſe ſtands as to our receiving and our expecting the anſwer of our Prayers in kind.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As we may and ſhall have all the Promiſes that are made to Faith made good to us, though we do not believe that we have Faith, and by Conſequence do not believe they ſhall have them made good to us; ſo when we pray for thoſe things God hath promiſed to thoſe who love or fear God, or walk uprightly, though we do not believe we have that fear or love, or that we walk uprightly, if we have thoſe Graces we ſhall receive the Promiſes made to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As there are two kinds of aſſurance, one which comes from the Teſtimony of our own ſpirits, when upon ſerious examination of our ſelves, we find that we do believe; the other which comes from the Teſtimony of the Spirit of God, witneſſing with our Spirits; So there are two kinds of aſſurance of receiving the thing we ask, one which proceeds from our believing and improving our believing the Power and goodneſſe of God and Chriſts Intereſt in God, and Gods delighting to honour Chriſt, by giving the mercies we ask in his name, the other from Gods immediate aſſuring us that we ſhall receive the very mercy we pray for.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the immediate Teſtimony of the Spirit comes with more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then the Teſtimony of our own Spirits, ſo the immediate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that God gives that we ſhall receive the things we pray for, is clearer and fuller then that which we have by our relying upon the Power and goodneſſe of God, or to ſpeak more properly, we do more fully rely upon the goodneſſe and Power of God when God doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately enable us ſo to do, then when we work out this Confidence by our own endeavours, aſſiſted by the ordinary concurrence of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As it is not our ſin to want the imme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iate Teſtimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo it is not our ſin not to have this particular aſſurance of receiving what we ask. Theſe Parallels may be far more enlarged, and will hold as I think in all particulars.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of this is, 1. For Conſolation to all that love and fear God; for thy not believing God will grant thy Prayers, ſhall not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy Prayers from being accepted and granted; for although if thine unbelief were built upon thy not believing Gods Power or goodneſſe to do what thou prayeſt for would hinder thee, yet ſince thy diffidence proceeds from thy not believing that thou art ſuch an one as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made to, ſuch thine unbelief ſhall not make the promiſe of

            <p n="1">1. Thou ſhalt be ſure to get an intereſt in the Promiſes, for they are made to ſuch as have the Graces, not to thoſe that know that they have thoſe Graces, and if thou haſt a Title thou ſhalt have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By getting greater degrees of Graces, the trouble of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:46545:177"/> will be needleſſe, it will ſave thee that labour, whereas otherwiſe thou wilt perpetually be put to examination: As for inſtance; Thou findeſt a ſpark of fire and covereſt it up again, and letteſt it lye wet, to morrow thou wilt be as far to ſeek, and wilt as hardly find the ſpark and know whether there be any fire to morrow as to day. Another knowing where to have fire cloſe by, knows ſhe can as ſoon fetch it from her neighbour as find it on her own hearth, if there be but a ſpark or two, ſhe therefore fetches ſome, and blows up into a flame, and ſhe layes on fewel to keep in the fire; So thou knoweſt where thou mayeſt have Gods Love, <hi>viz.</hi> from God, <hi>who is near unto them that call upon him,</hi> they know they may have it ſooner by Prayer then find it by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; this they blow into a flame, and as when the fire flames we may be ſure there is fire without poring to find it; So when thy Graces are in an eminent degree they are ſo apparent, that one that hath but half an eye may ſee them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By getting the Conditions to which the Promiſe is made, thou ſhalt often get what is better then the Promiſe it ſelf; for the Promiſe is often Temporal when the Condition is Spiritual.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Study much or rather Meditate much upon theſe great Goſpel Myſteries of Chriſts Satisfaction, of Chriſts Intereſt in the Fathers Love, and of the Fathers delight to honour the Son, by giving mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and pardoning ſinners for his ſake. Know that thou greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoureſt Chriſt when thou goeſt timerouſly to God for any Mercy in his Name, and it greatly argues thine infidelity: Suppoſe thy friend that was bound with thee for ſome great ſum of money, and he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there were Sergeants to arreſt thee, ſhould put himſelf into their hands to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ve thee from priſon, and he ſhould be carried to priſon and pay the debt, and ſend thee word that he had paid the debt every far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if thou ſhouldeſt notwithſtanding be afraid to ſee thy Creditor, or ſtirr abroad, would it not argue that thou believedſt not thy friend had paid the debt?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Go then with Confidence to God in the Name of Chriſt, ſince Chriſt hath bid thee, or elſe thou haſt ſtrange thoughts of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a friend of yours ſhould bid you go to ſuch a great man for ſuch a Courteſie, and ſhould tell thee that he had ſpoken to him in thy behalf, and bid thee not fear, for he could have any thing of him that he ſpoke to him for, and ſhould bid thee go to him in his Name, and tell him he ſent thee, if thou ſhouldeſt ſtand conſidering what to do, and ſhouldeſt fear that for all thy friend profeſſed he had ſo great an Intereſt in that great man, you ſhould not find it ſo when you came to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:46545:178"/> him, would not this ſhow that you feared your friend boaſted of more Intereſt then he had.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath plainly bid us go to the Father in his Name from him, and that we ſhall have any thing whatſoever; if we doubt whether when we go to the Father in his Name we ſhall obtain, doth it not plainly argue our low thoughts of Chriſts Intereſt in the Fathers Love, and that Chriſt hath higher thoughts of his Intereſt in his Fathers Love then indeed he hath. The ſenſe of thine own unworthineſſe ſhould by no means hinder thee, except thou wenteſt to God in thine own Name, for the Queſtion in this caſe is not how God loves thee, but how God loves Chriſt. Thou haſt thoughts high enough of Gods Love to Chriſt, if thou knoweſt that God loves Chriſt more then he hates any ſinner in the World. Thy thoughts are not high enough of Chriſts Love to thee, if thou thinkeſt Chriſt will deny thee any thing, nor haſt thou worthy thoughts of Gods Love to Chriſt, if thou thinkeſt God will deny Chriſt any thing, or any one that comes to him in his Name whom he bid ſo to do, for in ſo doing he doth not ſo properly deny thee as Chriſt.</p>

There is alſo in every ſin, a ſpot, ſtain or brand, whereby the ſinner is marked out for Judgment and Condemnation; as we ſay of a Murtherer as to man,<note place="margin">Deu. 32.5. Jer. 13.23. Jer. 17.1.</note> ſo we may ſay of every ſin (which is hatred and ſo murther of the Bleſſed God) as to God, there is alwayes ſome mark or token whereby he is known; and that is the <hi>macula,</hi> which ſin doth impreſſe upon him; now this alſo, is an indelible Character, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of Guilt was (ſave only when upon the penitent heart-changing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the blood of ſprinkling there is made an alteration of the caſe.) It is plain, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1. <hi>It is written with a pen of Iron and the point of a Diamond.</hi> Jer. 2.22. <hi>Though thou take thee much nitre, and waſh thee with much ſope, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, ſaith the Lord. David</hi> cries out ſo, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. <hi>O! waſh me, purge me!</hi> &amp;c. this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon from ſin.</p>
            <p>The third is from the ſinner himſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> from his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>There is in every rational Creature, a certain thing called Conſcience, upon the account of which alſo ſin muſt needs be kept up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the file for a back-blow. Know here that</p>
            <p>There are divers acts of Conſcience, and all of them unavoidable, 1. Directive, as to that which is to be done, it being the Law written in the heart, it points to all the duties and ſins, whereby that Law is kept or broken, warning from the one, and putting on to the other, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>How ſhall I do this, and ſin, &amp;c.</hi> Pſalm. 119.59. <hi>I conſidered my wayes, and turned my feet into thy teſtimonies;</hi> thus Conſcience is a Monitor.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Reflexive, both <hi>gratulatory</hi> and <hi>reprehenſive,</hi> as to all that which is doing or done. 1. Conſidering, obſerving, and recording, whether it be done, or no, the matter of fact ſimply with the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Circumſtances of action negative and poſitive, both in the point of Omiſſion and Commiſſion. <hi>Item</hi> this is done or not done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Taking notice and recording the quality of the fact in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative act, comparing it with the rule, together with the moral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereof; thus Conſcience is a ſurveyer, witneſſe, Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. <hi>Item</hi> in the doing or omitting of this and this the Law is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the forfeiture and penalty is incurred.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It applies this and ſets it home upon the ſinner, thou art the man. This thou haſt done, verily thou art guilty, &amp;c. thus Conſcience is a Judge alſo, and gives ſentence touching both the ſin and ſinner, <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on</hi> as the Caſe is.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It never leaves nor gives over theſe acts of warning, obſerving,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:46545:182"/> recording, witneſſing and judging, till Judgment take place, and the Law, and ſentence be fulfilled upon the ſinner. Verily I am guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c. thus Conſcience is Tormenter and Executioner alſo, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its own Sentence by affecting the heart, and moving the affections as of joy and boldneſſe if the Caſe be good; ſo of horrour and fear, ſhame and ſorrow, if the Caſe be bad, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now theſe acts of Conſcience, though happly for a time ſuſpended as it were, are unavoidable, upon a double account: and Conſcience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bribed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe of that relation, that Conſcience hath to God, it ever takes God's part, and God it's; it is Gods deputy, and Viceroy; and ſo it's voice and judgment is the very Voice and Judgment of God himſelf; who can and will maintain it in its office, till he brings forth Judgment unto victory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe of it's relation to a mans ſelf; it is <hi>Senſus &amp; prejudicium Judicii Divini.</hi> Nothing ſo intimate to a man, and inſeparable from life, as this boſome Judge, and God's Court within a man, 'tis a part of a mans Soul and ſelf as ſubordinate to God and his Judgment; So that if a man can run away from God, or himſelf, then he may eſcape the reflection of his ſin upon him, but if not, then know,<note place="margin">Jer. 2.19.</note> it muſt be an evil and bitter thing, that thou haſt departed from God in any known ſin, either to thy penitent amendment or penal condemnation and confuſion, and that upon all accounts. 1. In reſpect of God. 2. Of Sin. 3. Of the Sinner himſelf. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Thine own wickedneſſe ſhall reprove thee, thine own iniquity ſhall correct thee;</hi> all the time thou abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in ſin thou art gathering either Hemlock to poyſon thee, or Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood to make thy life bitter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Inſtruction: 1. See then the malignity and danger of ſin. Fools <label type="milestone">

            <p n="2">2. See the vanity, ſinfulneſſe, and deſperate danger of preſuming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any bottom of peace and ſatisfaction or ſecurity, whilſt ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: of a truth thy peace and hope thereof ſhall be as a Spiders web, and as the giving up of the Ghoſt, and thy preſumption muſt end in deſpair; bribeſt thou thy ſelf with a perſwaſion of peace, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming and leaning</p>

            <p n="2">2. Upon outward Priviledges? <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21. God knows thee not, whileſt thou art a worker of iniquity.</p>

Even ſo when a man is arreſted with ſickneſſe or ſome other outward diſtreſſe, then come in upon him, the debts, wherein he is bound over unto the Divine Law; when all is well with us, we can eaſily caſt theſe debts on the ſcore of Chriſt, but now 'tis hot work. Affliction is the glaſſe of ſin, and the opening, and awakening the Conſcience to ſee it, and thence comes the Trouble
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46545:186"/> upon the Spirit; It is not all the ſtormy winds upon the face of the earth, but ſome generated in the bowels thereof which makes the earth ſhake.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It ariſeth from Satan. When the eye of Conſcience is moſt open, <label type="milestone">

In affliction he would make breaches between God and us, us and God, and us and our ſelves, (if we muſt needs be ſenſible of them) gulphs out of which there is no redemption; he temp s us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin in proſperity, and then for ſin in adverſity, as we find in <hi>Jobs</hi> Caſe, even in thoſe which he knows are out of his reach, (where leaſt ſtrength and ground to do any thing there;) he is moſt malicious, as it appears in his bold attempts upon our Lord: If he cannot run thee upon a rock, yet he will diſquiet thee with a tempeſt, if he cannot rob thee of thy grace, yet he will of thy peace and comfort.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It ariſeth from the weakneſs of faith, and ſtrength of ſenſe, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>6</label> God in affliction as our enemy, eſpecially if there be ſome willing correſpondence between us &amp; any thing which God hates, God is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to us.

            </p>
            <p n="7">7. It ariſeth from Gods withdrawing. Thus with Chriſt; when God <label type="milestone">

But when moſt outward trouble came upon him, when his Murderers &amp; the Traytor were upon him, and his life drew near to the grave, as it was prefigured in <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 116.3.</note> when the ſorrows or dangers of death compaſſed him about, then the terrours of hell took hold upon him, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> terrours ariſing from this, the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of the Divine Love and Countenance.<note place="margin">Mar. 14.34.</note> Now come his aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, diſmaying fears and ſorrows, preſſing even to death, making him as it were to ſhrink from the great work of his own mercy.

            <p n="1">1. A word to them which are yet in their ſins out of Chriſt; And it is 1. Of Conviction. 2. Counſel.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Conviction, and terrour to them which are out of Chriſt. If Gods People be lyable to inward and outward trouble at once, wherein yet there is not a drop of wrath; What ſhall the viſitaſion of the reſt be wherein there is not a drop of ſaving pity? If they may be ſo hardly put to it which yet are ever ſecretly and mightily ſupported, what ſhall they do that have no ſtrength but their own to bear up under the mighty hand of God? Surely if they ſmart ſevenfold: the wicked muſt be avenged ſeventy times ſevenfold. If the cup of affliction, by reaſon of the bitter ingredient of inward perplexity, be ſo bitter to them, what becomes of them for whom the dregs of that Cup are reſerved? The godly may ſtand condemned at their own Bar, but the wicked at Gods too, and nothing remains to them but a certain expectation of execution without a change. O! if <hi>Jacob</hi> halt, ſure <hi>Eſaus</hi> back and bones muſt be broken; If the righteous be (by reaſon of ſharp afflictions within and without) ſcarcely ſaved, (to whom yet all afflictions are through grace ever ſufferable, ſhort, and ſanctified,) where ſhall the ſinner appear when his ſins and ſorrows ſhall meet together? There be three daies wherein thou ſhalt never be able to hold up thy head, and yet thou muſt appear: Firſt, A day of extream Calamity; Secondly, Of Death; Thirdly, of Judgment. Oh! remember how ſad it goes with the godly in a day of outward Calamity becauſe of inward trouble joyning with it through gradual want of Knowledge, Faith, and Evidence, the venome of ſin, unmortified malice of Satan, not yet quite troden under their feet, and the withdrawing of Gods Grace and Countenance in part? And conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how thou wilt ſpeed, which haſt no ſaving Knowledge, no Faith, no Intereſt, art under the raign of ſin and Satan, whom the holy and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46545:187"/> jealous God cannot endure to behold but with revenge and execration. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. <hi>David</hi> had fainted (in his affliction) had he not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Surely then thou muſt utterly faint becauſe thou haſt not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an heart to underſtand and believe to this day: The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, notwithſtanding all their inw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rd and outward preſſures, can ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſighs for them all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9. <hi>We are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed,</hi> (ſo as there is no way to eſcape or bear up;) We are perplexed, but not in deſpair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not quite deſtroyed. But if thou lookeſt not to it betimes, ſuch a day will come upon thee, as wherein thou ſhalt be ſo beſet with trouble, that thou wilt be abſolutely concluded, and ſhut out from all relief; ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, that thou wilt deſpair; ſo purſued (by the avengers of bloud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>) that thou wilt be quite forſaken of heaven and earth; ſo caſt down, that thou wilt be utterly deſtroyed, and daſhed in pieces. Oh! if trouble, ſuch trouble may ſeize on Gods dear ones, what reprobate fear and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſhall take hold on thee that art a ſtranger, a ſlave, an enemy, and yet ſecure and preſumptuous in that condition?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a word of Counſel to thee, as to be an alarm to thy ſecurity, ſo an Antidote to thy preſumption and cenſoriouſneſs in reference to the godly. The men of the world can eaſily paſs over the beams of raging wickedneſs in themſelves and their own, but they maliciouſly and proudly aggravate the motes of infirmity in the godly. If they carry themſelves unbecomingly by any impatience under the hand of God: now they are hypocrites preſently, now they ſink, notwithſtanding they would ſeem to have ſpecial intereſt in, and acquaintance with God to bear them up. Thus was <hi>Job</hi> cenſured, even by his friends, for which God cenſures them, and that with wrath, <hi>Job</hi> 42.7. Thus Gods People ſerve themſelves, but eſpecially they have this meaſure from the men of the World, They ſee them droop and walk heavily under ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward burden, which they think is but ordinary; they ſee them faint, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drunk of the cup of affliction which is common, but alas they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not what may be (the weight of their burden) within, what bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ingredients may be in their Cup, as to their inward man. Now the Spirit is the man, the mind is the ſtrength, and they are not aware how tender the love of God hath made that, and how grieved and broken that may be upon ſome ſpiritual account between God and them. <hi>Joab</hi> reproves <hi>David</hi> for mourning ſo exceſſively for <hi>Abſolom,</hi> (&amp; at firſt ſight we may think it ſtrange that ſo eminent a Saint as <hi>David</hi> ſhould ſo take on for an outward loſs more as it ſeems than for the loſs of Gods favour &amp; grace) but <hi>Joab</hi> did not know and conſider what viſitation there might
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46545:188"/> be within <hi>David,</hi> while God ſtood over him with that outward rod; how God might ſet on that outward blow with ſome inward ſmart, and rebuke upon his Spirit in ſuch an intimation as this, O! <hi>David,</hi> thou that wert ſo obliged to me more than thouſands, I'll make thee know 'tis an evil and bitter thing to provoke me, and diſhonour my Name as thou haſt done, thy child is dead, <hi>Abſolom</hi> is gone with a curſe, and <hi>Adonijah</hi> ſhall follow, and now what h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Averſion from God, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate clinging and cleaving to the creature, is the whole corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature.

               </gap>o ſeveral kinds.

               </gap> or the things that are juſt neceſſary and convenient, and no other, being alwaies in particular actions very
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:46545:196"/> difficult to define, as the Pliloſopher acknowledgeth, who ſaith, there is nothing more full of difficulty then in every thing to find the meane. The Rule he layes down to walk by, is Reaſon, and a prudent man's determination; the beſt nature affords, and are eſpecially good for the Duties of the ſecond Table, which he only (though not to all) ſpeaks of; yet we (through the goodneſs of God) have a more ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one to guide us, to which we ſhall do well to take heed, even the Scriptures, which are able to make us wiſe to ſalvation. It will be worth our while, to ſpeak briefly what we can, touching the <hi>Rule,</hi> which in general muſt guide and determine our Moderation. For which end we muſt know, that all our humane actions, which are capable of moral good or evil, are of two ſorts, eſpecially according to their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>Religious,</hi> or <hi>Civil.</hi> The former requires a Spiritual principle, end, and rule, by which we muſt perform them for their manner and meaſure, which Scripture doth abundantly for the internal by it's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and ſufficiently for the external, by it's general precepts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. For the latter or Civil actions, as a natural principle, and end referrible to Gods glory; ſo alſo for their manner and meaſure, the general Rules of Scripture to allow, and preſcribe them, is all we can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect, and is ſufficient for the ſame. In the application where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Reaſon and prudent determination are three wayes ſubſervient.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In judging the nature or quality of the objects in general, which we are particularly imployed about, (as the good things or evils of this life, in the particulars wherein we are converſant) according to what Scripture declares them to be, when it ſpeaks of them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not comparitively, but abſolutely what they are in themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the end God hath ordained ſuch things for, about which he hath commanded us to be imployed, and accordingly to proportion our actions. It being a known Rule in the Schooles, <hi>Omnium appetibilium finis est menſura,</hi> or, that the end is that which muſt preſcribe the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our actings, according to it's double reſpect, <hi>rei, &amp; perſonae,</hi> for what, and for whom the action is.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, in due conſideration of the circumſtances of the Agent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is ſuch great variety, not only in regard of the perſon, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves the end <hi>for whom</hi> the action is, but all the adjacent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that herein occurs by farr the greateſt difficulty. For example, in meats and drinks. Conſider diligently their nature in thoſe ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee; then their end, for refreſhing us, not feeding our luſts; and of thy ſelf, what is ſufficient and convenient for thee in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thou art then in, and accordingly uſe them, or put <hi>a knife to thy
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:46545:196"/> throat and refrain,</hi> as the Wiſe man ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.2. for that which may but be ſufficient for one, may ſerve for another to make his belly his God: yea that which may be only convenient to the ſame perſon at one time, may be gluttony and exceſſe at another. And as about things, ſo in our dealing with others much more variety, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our ſelves and thoſe we have to do withal. As we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that to one, we need not, nay ſome times ought not to another, according to our own and their capacity; as they are poorer or richer than our ſelves, as they are weak, or wilful and malicious oppoſers of truth or equity; and a thouſand ſuch like conſiderations, which occur in our actions, which though alwayes ſufficient in themſelves to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ermin us, yet becauſe of our ſhortneſſe of ſight, are often but as the uncertain twinkling ſtar-light to us, whereby to ſteer our courſe. All that's ſaid of Moderation will more clearly appear, if we conſider it's <hi>Extreames</hi> from the nature of God's Commands, which are of two ſorts. 1. Some are affirmative, and thoſe either general what we muſt do, &amp;c. and imply the end for which, and all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that neceſſarily attend our doing it: Or particular, and expreſs the circumſtances external, as time and place, and internal (uſually called the manner) which comprehends the quality, and the moral quantity or proportion, (we are ſpeaking of,) which implies the <hi>intenſeneſs, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency,</hi> and <hi>duration</hi> of our actions. Theſe continually oblige us, though not to continual practice, but only when God requires; the former by way of more abſoluteneſs, the latter more conditionally, as depending <hi>thereupon.</hi> 2. The other ſort of precepts are negative, ſome what we muſt not do, and ſo conſequently at once forbid all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of ſuch actions as are prohibited; others not forbidding us the object, but rectifying us about it, in the end we moſt do it for, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how, &amp;c. both which obliges us to continual obſervance, and in morals <hi>to the contrary duties.</hi> By which it appeares, in our not right proportioning our actions, we ſin in omiſſion, by not doing ſo fully as he commands, in commiſſion when we do thoſe things that are our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but exceed therein, and go beyond the bounds God hath ſet us, and this is formally immoderateneſs, which is rectified by Moderation. As for actions materially evil, as <hi>Jonah</hi>'s being angry with God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting virtue, and loving vice, &amp;c. which are abſolutely forbidden, no proportion is to have place, but it and all other circumſtances toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the action, wholly avoided or ſuppreſſed, becauſe towards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due objects forbidden us there can be no defect, in regard there ſhould be no action, and therefore no Moderation or government thereof.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46545:197"/> For inſtance in thoſe two great Commands, on which hang all the Law and the Prophets, as our bleſſed Saviour tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.46. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> Luke 10.27. Here's the grace of Love required to act towards God, the manner expreſt, in <hi>heart, ſoul, ſtrength, mind,</hi> the meaſure in the four <hi>all's</hi> (the New Teſtament adding one to the three of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, ſo far is the Goſpel from detracting from duty,) here can be no exceſſe, in regard we can never love him as he deſerves, not only in regard of what he hath done for us, but is to us, being our end and happineſſe: and towards our Neighbour, the manner expreſt, <hi>as thy ſelf,</hi> i. e. truly and ſincerely, but not <hi>with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. that's only God's due, who is abſolutely to be loved for himſelf, others for him. Herein alas Grace is defective, but never exceeds, ſo that Moderation hath here no place, for if we love any perſon or thing more than God, Chriſt, and our ſelves, it is not the action of Grace but ſinful affection, which is to be moderated.

            <p>Caſe. <hi>Wherein must we practiſe Moderation.</hi>

            <p>Which neceſſarily implies the <hi>external object,</hi> or about what our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration muſt be converſant, and appear to all: call it the <hi>object</hi> of the <hi>faculty</hi> or of the <hi>action,</hi> or of <hi>Moderation,</hi> when imployed in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning theſe, and ſo hath the ſame object with them (as is ſaid before) it all comes to one.</p>
            <p>And formally includes. 1. <hi>What it is that we muſt Moderate;</hi> or the <hi>faculty,</hi> or <hi>principle,</hi> of what kind ſoever internal and external, from which the action flows. 2. <hi>In what actions.</hi> And 3. <hi>How,</hi> or the meaſure and proportion to be obſerved in ſuch our actions. Which three are allwayes diſtinct in themſelves, though not alwayes eaſily diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us, and therefore often ſeem coincident. I ſhall therefore joyn them together in the proſecution of the Caſe.</p>
            <pb n="388" facs="tcp:46545:198"/>
            <p>For the general Object of Moderation, or about what it muſt be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and appear. Negatively.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not ſuch things as are materially good.</hi> About ſuch things, or in ſuch actions as are materially good, Moderation hath no place; becauſe all the good we can poſſibly do, is too little, ſo that there can be no exceſſe in theſe, and therefore no Moderation; for the Office of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration being to reſtrain exceſſe, where there can be none of this, that can have no imployment. <hi>e. g.</hi> we cannot believe in, hope, love God and Chriſt too much, nor hate ſin, and Sathan (as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men affirm, in regard of his wholly looſing the Image of God too much. In all our internal religious duties, and actings of Grace, as ſuch, no Moderation therefore can or ought to have place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Not about ſuch things as are materially evil.</hi> For herein we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be defective. Where the object is abſolutely forbidden us, and no circumſtances can make the action good, there we are wholly to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, or ſuppreſſe the action, if in it; there being inordinacy in the principle or faculty; for though Moderation is to govern even the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, yet not in the choice of it's object, but in it's exerciſe about a due object choſen that it exceed not. And though we call any great acting upon an undue object, or great omiſſion towards due, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, becauſe of their exceſſe, yet this is not properly immoderacy, for ſo every ſin would be it formally, whereas thoſe only which reſpect the moral quantity of our actions, are properly immoderacies. Both theſe ſufficiently appear by what's ſaid before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poſitively.</hi> But about ſuch things as are in themſelves of an indifferent nature, and neither abſolutely commanded as things materially good, or abſolutely forbidden, as thoſe materially evil, but only conditionally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the circumſtances we are in. Which though of an indifferent nature, yet become morally good or evil to us, as we are actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about them. In theſe properly may be exceſſe, in regard of which Moderation is to take place to reſtrain, and keep all within due bounds, being formally the <hi>modification</hi> (to uſe the School term for once) of ſuch actions. Wherein we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh of the ſeveral formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the object, Grace and Nature being converſant about the ſame object, but not in the ſame reſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For it's exerciſe therefore, or what, wherein, and how we muſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which I ſhall ſpeak of 1. Abſolutely in reference to our ſelves, for preſerving peace within, as it is to be exerciſed towards the good and evils of this life.</p>

The Apoſtle not ſaying, uſe Moderation <hi>towards</hi> all men, but let it appear <hi>to</hi> all men, which even that which is internal doth in our external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. But though there be abundance of excellent fruit on this branch of Moderation, yet in regard I conceive that <hi>towards perſons</hi> principally intended, I will not ſtand to ſhake it down, but only point you out briefly the boughs, on which it eſpecially grows, that you may gather it your ſelves, and proceed to the ſecond, <hi>Moderation towards others,</hi> which I ſhall only proſecute afterwards in all the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Now the <hi>good things</hi> of this life being either <hi>internal,</hi> of the mind as parts, learning, &amp;c. of the body, as health, ſtrength, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the like; or <hi>external,</hi> as the riches, honours, relations, and lawful pleaſures of the World, and what comprehended under them: And the <hi>evils</hi> of this life, ſuch as are contrary to theſe, as ſhallowneſſe of parts natural or acquired, ſickneſſe, weakneſſe, death, deformity, poverty, loſſes of friends or eſtate, infamy, reproaches, troubles, warrs, hunger, thirſt, nakedneſſe, impriſonment, captivity, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch like: we are towards theſe to exerciſe Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Towards the good things of this life.</hi> 1. <hi>We muſt moderate our Judgements in the valuation of them.</hi> As forbidden fruit muſt not be looked upon, ſo lawful muſt not be judged by us more deſirable then it is. As we may not undervalue theſe good things, and with the <hi>Stoick</hi> deſpiſe and caſt them away; ſo we muſt not over-value them, beyond their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick worth and the ends for which God allows them, the end and uſe being the meaſure of every things eſtimation. For though every creature be good in it ſelf, and ſome better in themſelves, and to us than others: yet thoſe that are the beſt, and beſt for us that the World affords, are ſtill but creatures, who are moſt of them ſerviceable only to our bodyes, that they may be ſerviceable to our Souls, in the ſervice of our Heavenly Father: which when we too much eſtimate, we quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall to admire, and ſo bow down to them, and commit idolatry with them. For an overvaluation of the Judgement, begets in us admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo an over-valuation of them alſo in our affections. Theſe
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:46545:199"/> ſenſitive objects make ſuch impreſſions upon our imagination when abſent, and our paſſions when preſent, that if Grace and Reaſon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate not our Judgement of them, our whole man becomes inflamed therewith, and violently carryed out towards them, by an exceſſive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of their ſeeming excellency, love to them for the ſame, and deſire after them, for their apprehended ſutableneſſe, hope to obtain them ſeeming poſſible, uſing means for obtaining them, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and glorying in them. Therefore our Saviour preſcribes wiſely, that our hearts may not be in them, the light of our minds being ſingle, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.22, 23. When <hi>Achan (Joſh.</hi> 7.21.) judged the Babyloniſh garment <hi>goodly,</hi> and the ſilver and gold, then he quickly coveted and took them. Let thy Moderation therefore begin here, and conſider the character <hi>Solomon</hi> upon good experience gives them, that they are all to us in this degenerate ſtate <hi>vanity of vanities,</hi> yea <hi>vexation of Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Moderate thy will and affections, in their love, deſires, hopes, after the getting or keeping theſe things; according to the ends for which God allows them thee in particular, and with ſubordination to his pleaſure and providence in the event.</hi> We muſt value, love, deſire, God and Chriſt, and hope in them, abſolutely and for themſelves, and Grace abſolutely, but for the injoyment of them (and conſequently for our own happineſſe;) but ſo muſt we not theſe things; but only conditionally, as God in his All-wiſe-diſpoſing providence ſees meet to diſpenſe to us, (he having ſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed them,) and for thoſe ends and ſo far forth as they are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for us,</hi> according to <hi>Agars</hi> deſire, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency is to be meaſured by the eſtate the Providence of God hath ſet us in, and the circumſtances wherein we are. As ſo much health, ſtrength, refreſhment, comfortableneſſe in our lives, as God ſees good for us and may render us ſerviceable to him; ſo much food, raiment, profit, pleaſure as he pleaſeth to beſtow, and ſo far forth as convenient for us, according to our preſent condition, for our health, and other ends now mentioned to which they refer; but neither theſe nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good things of this life abſolutely, or for themſelves, ſo as to make them our end and happineſſe, or to be fuel for our luſts, muſt we either love deſire or hope for. It is not thus deſiring the lawful pleaſures, profits, honours of this life, which St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> c. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 16. but the immoderacy of the deſiring them which he calls <hi>lust,</hi> and ſaith <hi>is of the World;</hi> as well he may, ſeeing this is the Trinity that it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally worſhipeth more than the bleſſed Trinity of Heaven.

He that hath one field, would have, and complains if he have not two; he that hath, two for four he that hath ten, for twenty, and he that hath twenty, twice ſo many; and ſo on, no number ſatisfying his deſire. For though it be great before, when we enjoy any thing it then ſeems ſmall to us; as a thouſand talents of Gold, when we have them are ſmall to two, and two to ten, and ſo on. In honors likewiſe, he that governs a City is not ſatisfied becauſe he governs not the Nation, and if the Nation, that not more; as <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Darius,</hi> and <hi>Xerxes</hi> mighty Princes, yet they wanted <hi>Greece</hi> they thought, which cauſed their Expeditions againſt it.

And yet though the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which had not the Goſpel, as the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours time, were ſo immoderate; yet many of them were ſuch as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their works, and lives; as I fear will riſe up in Judgement in this particular, againſt moſt of us that call our ſelves <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> They beholding the buſie World (as one of them ſpeaks of the Souls in the other) as the Ant carrying a ſtraw, or ſome little thing of like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, into her hole in the Mole-hill; which yet dazels our eyes with their ſeeming luſter, and makes our hearts ſay of theſe our houſes as if they were our homes, <hi>'tis good for us to be here.</hi>

Are thy Riches any thing, but of the earth, and earthly? Thy Pleaſures any thing, but a little titillation of the fleſh, of no permanent nature, lives but one inſtant and dies as faſt?

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>When God is concerned therein; as in the Churches right.</hi> Thus <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> though the meekeſt man upon earth would <hi>not abate Pharaoh an hoofe,</hi> (Exod. 10.26.) <hi>for thereof muſt we ſerve the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and we know not with what, until we come thither,</hi> i. e, <hi>Canaan.</hi> A Miniſter may yield his own, but he muſt not the Churches right.</p>

Here ſo far as others conſent which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, we ſhould compoſe, yield, and take up controverſies; further we juſtly cannot; for in caſes of truſt, a man muſt be regulated by the will of thoſe that intruſt him; as Arbitrators and Sollicitors for others; So Executors frequently and Guardians, that are intruſted for thoſe that are young, and not yet <hi>ſui juris</hi> at age to conſent, and diſpoſe of their own; and the like caſes, wherein the intruſted are reſponſible for what is not legally done therein; the Laws determination being by all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed juſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In our own perſonal injuries, wherein the publick is concernd.</hi> 1. When publick peace, order and government are much violated and broken thereby. As in notorious thefts, attempts of murder, and the like; which if tolerated the World would become a great <hi>latrocinium,</hi> and ſlaughter-houſe, wherein the longeſt ſword and ſtrongeſt arm would ſweep away all, a place for beaſts but no quiet habitation for men. 2. When the publick emolument or eſtimation ſuffers in our injuries. As Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and all others imployed in publick affairs,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:46545:206"/> when groſly defam'd, ſo as the publick is thereby reflected on; ought fairly to vindicate their integrity ſo far at leaſt, that thoſe that imploy them, and the publike ſuffer not thereby. And laſtly, when thy ſerving the Publick, and conſequently the publick good is thereby hindred. How ample is the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his own vindication againſt the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles defamation of him, in his Second Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> which is much of it Apologetical.

And thus for moderation towards others in Civil matters.</p>

                  <p>Although I have ſpoken in the opening the nature of moderation, and the <hi>general Object,</hi> that which might ſerve to direct us herein: Yet leſt I be miſtaken, and thence any of you miſtake your duty; I ſhall further open this <hi>particular Object,</hi> by ſpeaking to it negatively about what moderation is not to be practiſed, and poſitively wherein it muſt.</p>

                     <hi>Negatively.</hi> 1 <hi>Not in matters of faith.</hi> For the believing theſe being not only abſolutely required of every Chriſtian, and in that meaſure that we cannot fully come up to, in regard of the great truth and reality of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual objects and their revelation, (the beſt being (alas!) miſerably ſhort and deficient herein:) but alſo internal, (the profeſſion of theſe being matter of practice) Moderation cannot poſſibly here have any place, much leſs that which reſpects others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor in matters of moral practice,</hi> ſuch as the Moral Law requires, and grace and vertue ſhould perform. For in theſe can be no exceſs either in degree or duration. We cannot love God too much, nor with grace our neighbour, nor too conſtantly. Conſider Father, Mother, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>as moral Objects,</hi> ſo we exceed not, as <hi>natural goods,</hi> and ſo in the exerciſe of natural affection, we frequently (as is ſaid before) do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:46545:207"/> which is diſcernable eſpecially by the end; with grace we love them for God, with the moral vertue of love for the relation they ſtand in to us, with the affection of love, when we ſinfully over-love them for our ſelves, for though the natural affection co-operates with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet it ſolely exceeds. But it being difficult for us to diſcern theſe <hi>formalities</hi> in objects, and the operations of principles about them, it is our only way to have recourſe to Gods Laws, (which though founded upon the nature of things, yet ſhews us plainly our duty, where we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern them) which, in all things wherein we may exceed, (as in the Externals of the Firſt Table, and the duties of the Second) not only preſcribe us what, and alſo particularly how to act by poſitive Precepts; but leſt we ſhould miſcarry by Negative alſo, which reſpect the end, manner, meaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of ſuch duties, reſtraining and bounding us that we exceed not. Both which are Moral, and comprehended in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it being equally moral not to over-love, as to love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the former being forbidden as well by the Negative, as the latter enjoyned by poſitive Precepts.</p>
                  <p>In Negatives which forbid the action <hi>abſolutely,</hi> (as Blaſphemy, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) no need of any ſuch Precepts to regulate us; for the actions being not to be done, no need of direction for their manner, and conſequently no place for Moderation; ſuch being to be ſubdued, and ſuppreſt, not ordered or regulated, as I have formerly ſpoken, and in things only <hi>indefinitely</hi> forbidden (as Swearing, Travelling on the Lords day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) when we are to practice them, we have the rules for Poſitive actions, Affirmative, and Negative to direct us ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Nor eſpecially in the weightier matters of the Law or Religion.</hi> I muſt ſpeak a little to this; becauſe that may be commanded <hi>abſolutely</hi> in it ſelf, which <hi>comparatively</hi> when it comes in competition with other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of greater moment, becomes only conditional. For Affirmative Precepts are ſo many, it is impoſſible they ſhould bind <hi>ad ſemper;</hi> ſo that when two or more duties come together, man, in regard of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite capacity, being not able to perform them at once, muſt duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weightieſt, and that do; it being requiſite in terms of inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency, that the leſſer alwaies give place to the greater, and ceaſe <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> or for that preſent to oblige us. Thus <hi>Davids</hi> eating the ſhew-bread, and the Diſciples plucking the ears of corn on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, when hungry, is defended by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. Yea, even frequently the externals of the Firſt Table, give way to the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exigent duties of the Second, (as the ſanctification of the Sabbath,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:46545:207"/> to the defending the City in the <hi>Macchabees</hi> caſe) according to that, <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice, Hoſ.</hi> 6.6. Not only <hi>rather than</hi> ſacrifice, but in ſuch caſes <hi>not</hi> ſacrifice. God diſpenſing with the leſſer, ſo that its omiſſion becomes no ſin: as is clear in our Saviours practice in his healing the man with the withered hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as in his defence of his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. For that may be our duty and neceſſary at one time, which at another (when a weightier comes that ſhould take place) ceaſeth to be ſo, by vertue of the reaſon and conſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Therefore under the notion of moderation to omit Moral, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the great and neceſſary duties required, and practice only the leſs, is Phariſaical hypocriſie, not Chriſtianity.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt moderate our ſpeeches, in our diſcourſes of, debates and conteſts for, or againſt theſe.</hi> Some ſpeeches we are too apt to we muſt wholly forbear, others we muſt moderate. 1. We muſt beware of judging and cenſuring others for theſe. We may in apparent tranſgreſſions of Gods Law cenſure upon occaſion the offenders, though not raſhly, or for hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, reprobates, or the like; but for theſe we muſt not at all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For in theſe, through anothers knowledge that may not be a ſin in him which would to thee, and thou judgeſt ſinful therefore in others for want of charity. How much malice, and how little can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor do we uſe in this! How do we almoſt make it the characteriſtical note of Chriſtianity, to be of ſuch or ſuch a way which none account eſſential to Religion! We are apt (as thoſe in <hi>Africa</hi> in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time) to account it enough that we or others are of ſuch a party; and to impale the Church, and impropriate Chriſt and ſalvation every one of us to our own ſide. And this many times the moſt, by the Vulgar, ſo true is that of <hi>Seneca, Qui pauca reſpiciunt, facilè pronunciant;</hi> Thoſe that diſcern the leaſt, being apt to judge moſt. 2. We muſt take heed of deſpiſing and contemning others for theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3. As the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of not judging, ſo this of not deſpiſing, is a neceſſary duty inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally as to our ſelves, and in our carriage and ſpeeches eſpecially, as they reſpect our external duty towards others; our ſinning in both ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from uncharitableneſs, in that to others liberty, in this to that we judge their weakneſs. Our hearts and tongues are too apt to follow our judgments, and break out into theſe exorbitancies; but, <hi>my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> theſe things ought not ſo to be; judge not, cenſure not according to outward appearance, or inward prejudice, but righteous and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment rather, that we mutually bear with one another in theſe. And when we have occaſion to diſcourſe or debate concerning what things are ſuch, or their practice; not meaſuring all mens judgments by the model of our own apprehenſions; or like Dictators, thinking our ſelves infallible, obtrude thoſe things for neceſſary, which it may be others of as piercing ſight account but indifferent, or thoſe things for indifferent which they reckon amongſt the number of unlawfuls, but modeſtly declaring our judgments herein. For as I told you in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, I take not upon me to determine what are ſuch, nor the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates duty, (concerning which, I think he ſaid well and wiſely, <hi>That

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>We muſt moderate our practiſing of theſe according to the circumſtances we are in, and as they are convenient and expedient for us.</hi> Sometimes the practiſe of theſe muſt be wholly waved; for the Laws concerning them being <hi>conditional</hi> as to their doing or not doing: (though not as to the manner thereof,) and not <hi>abſolute</hi> as of neceſſary duties, their practiſe becomes ſuſpended on ſuch conditions; which (beſides that I formerly mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> when they come in competition with greater matters) are eſpecially three. In regard of our ſelves diſſatisfaction of <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> In regard of others, <hi>known ſcandal,</hi> and <hi>diſturbance of publick ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led peace.</hi> When any of theſe caſes occur, wherein the condition on which the command is ſuſpended is awanting, the command there (as all other conditionals) become <hi>negative.</hi> For we are obliged abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in moral duties to do them, and for the manner rightly, they being no wayes ſuſpended as to practiſe, but in theſe only abſolutely for the manner, that if we do them we do them rightly; and conditionally if we be ſatisfied in our judgements, and offend not others thereby, or diſturb the publick peace; the firſt being knowledge in our ſelves, the other two charity to others, if we do them. And therefore where there is no place left for charity to others, as in caſe of equal ſcandal on both hands, thy doing or forbearing; there thou art at liberty. In which caſe in ſmaller matters, that which is leaſt obſervable is beſt; in greater matters according to thy concernments and charity to thy ſelf, and for general good (if the publick be intereſted in thee.) For when we cannot know on which ſide, our doing or not doing moſt evil to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lies, charity to our ſelves preponderates ſuppoſals of the iſſue.</p>
                  <p>But time permits me not to launch out into diſcourſes of theſe caſes, my Subject alſo confining me to the exerciſe of Moderation, which when the action is to be wholly omitted, is not required, it's office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only (as I have often ſaid) in the regulating of actions. As we muſt therefore uſe modeſty in our ſpeeches for or againſt theſe, ſo alſo in our practiſing them according to conveniency and expediency, not too violently running our ſelves out of breath, or a-tilt at others, in our practiſing them, but with that equalneſſe of ſpirit and candor towards others as becomes us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19. and 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16.</p>

Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compaſſion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; not rendring evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwiſe bleſſing; knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye ſhould inherit a bleſſing,</hi> (1 Pet. 3.8, 9.) <hi>and that the Lord is at hand, ready to beſtow it upon all thoſe that make their moderation known unto all men.</hi>

               </gap>h God in the performance of that duty; without which it had been dangerous preſumption in him <hi>who was but Duſt and Aſhes to take upon him to ſpeak unto the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Example of <hi>Abraham</hi> I ſhall endeavour to draw forth for our Practiſe and Imitation; He who is made to us a Pattern of Faith, may be to us a Pattern of true Worſhip; and ſuch apprehenſions or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions <hi>Abraham</hi> had of God in ſpeaking to him, Such conceptions of God we are to have in our Prayers and performances to him.</p>
            <p>For which end I ſhall lay down this General Propoſition.</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">

               <hi>That ſuch as ſpeak to God, or ſpeak of God; ſuch as draw near to God or have to do with God in any part of Divine Worſhip, muſt manage all their performances with right apprehenſions and due conceptions of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth of this General Propoſition I ſhall endeavour to manifeſt and make clear by laying down Four particular Propoſitions which muſt give evidence to it.</p>
            <p>The Firſt Propoſition is this; That we cannot have any true, right apprehenſions, or conceptions of God, except we have a true knowledge of him; Such as have not known God have ſlighted him, <hi>Who is the Lord</hi> ſaith <hi>Pharaoh, that I ſhould obey him; I know not the Lord;</hi> Exod. 5.2. Such as know not God, nor deſire to know him, are ſo far from drawing near to God, that they drive him as far from them as they can; they ſay unto the Almighty, <hi>Depart from us, who deſire not the knowledge of his wayes,</hi> Job 21.14.</p>
            <p>What Counſel <hi>Eliphaz</hi> gave <hi>Job</hi> (whom he ſuppoſed to be a greater ſtranger to God than indeed he was) may be an uſeful inſtruction to us; <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with God</hi> — To know God and to be known of God is our higheſt priviledge; <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with God and be at peace;</hi> the reaſon why any are real enemies to God, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not God; and the reaſon why many think God is an enemy to them is, becauſe they are not acquainted with God, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately as they ſhould; <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with God</hi> (ſaith he) — and thereby Good ſhall come unto thee; But what Good? and how ſhall this Good come? It is partly expreſt <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, 24, 25. but more fully
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:46545:213"/> 
               <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27. <hi>For then ſhalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and ſhalt lift up thy face to God; Thou ſhalt make thy prayer unto him, and he ſhall hear thee, and thou ſhall pay thy vows;</hi> So that except we know God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and have ſome acquaintance with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im, we cannot delight our ſelves in God, we cannot make our prayer to him, nor lift up our face un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>The Second Propoſition is, That we cannot know any thing ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God further than he is pleaſed to manifeſt and make known him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us; No man can make known God but God himſelf; <hi>Moſes</hi> who had ſeen as much of Gods glory as any man, when he deſired a further manifeſtation of Gods glory in a higher meaſure or degree than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had ſeen, he goes to God himſelf for it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18. <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Promiſe Chriſt maketh to them that Love him and keep his Commandments is the manifeſtation of himſelf to them by Himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. — I will manifeſt my ſelf to them, for none elſe can, A Diſciple puts a Queſtion to him about it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Lord, how is it that thou milt manifeſt thy ſelf to us and not to the World?</hi> We have a clear Anſwer to this, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.21. this very Doctrine which is ſo much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of indignation to the wiſe and prudent of the World is matter of rejoycing and exaltation to the Spirit of Chriſt; and he ſaid, <hi>I thank thee O Father that thou haſt hid — and thou haſt revealed — For ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight;</hi> Hence is that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 17.25. <hi>O righteous Father, the World hath not known thee, but theſe have known</hi>—</p>
            <p>The Third Propoſition is, That the cleareſt manifeſtations of God to us, and ſuch as can beget in us right apprehenſions and due conceptions of him, are made out to us In and By Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten Son which is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him;</hi> Therefore no man ever did, or can apprehend any thing of God truly, that is, upon a ſaving account, but in and by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Divine Eſſence or Godhead, <hi>no man hath ſeen or can ſee in it ſelf,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.16.</p>
            <p>Something of this Eternal Godhead is manifeſted in the works of Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>The inviſible things of God,</hi> viz. <hi>his Eternal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Godhead</hi> are clearly ſeen in the things that are made; But yet this knowledge of God in the Creature could not bear down the vain Imagin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tions, or Idolatrous conception of God in mens hearts, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.23.</p>
            <p>Much of the Eternal Godhead is manifeſted in the works of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:46545:214"/> 
               <hi>God doth great things paſt finding out, and wonders without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; Yet loe, he goeth by us and we ſee him not, he paſſeth on alſo, but we perceive him not,</hi> Job 9.10, 11. God is Inviſible in himſelf and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible in his works; <hi>Job</hi> made it his work to trace God in his works, <hi>Job</hi> 23.8, 9. Sometimes God was working forward or before him, ſometimes backward or behind him; Sometimes on his right-hand, ſometimes at his left hand; <hi>Job</hi> follows him up and down if he might apprehend him, and the reaſon and deſigne of God in all his works, but he could not perceive him, God hid himſelf from him.</p>
            <p>Much more of the Eternal Godhead was manifeſted in his moſt righteous and holy Law; But the manifeſtations of God here affrighted them that ſaw it; the People cry out, <hi>Let not the Lord ſpeak any more to us leſt we dye;</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſaid, <hi>I exceedingly fear,</hi> ſo terrible was the ſight of God there, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.21.</p>
            <p>Hence it will follow, that the cleareſt, ſweeteſt, moſt comfortable manifeſtations of God to us, and ſuch as can beget in us right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and conceptions of God, are made out to us only in Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Image of the Inviſible God, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.15. In whom God hath made ſuch diſcoveries of himſelf as can no where be ſeen but in Chriſt; He is the expreſſe Image or Character of his Fathers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. The exact reſemblance of all his Fathers excellencies in their utmoſt perfections; therefore when <hi>Philip</hi> deſired him to ſhew them of the Father, to give them a ſight to ſatisfaction, <hi>John</hi> 14.9, 10. <hi>He that hath ſeen me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to him) <hi>hath ſeen the Father; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it Philip, I am in the Father and the Father is in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the works of Crearion God is a God above us, In his works of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence a God without us, In the Law a God againſt us, In himſelf a God Inviſible to us; Only in Chriſt he is <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God manifeſted in our Fleſh, God in us, God with us, God for us.</p>
            <p>Hence follows the Fourth Propoſition; That the manifeſtations of God to us in Chriſt, are thoſe which alone can beget thoſe due appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and right Conceptions of God, with which we muſt draw near to him, and perform all our worſhip to him.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Abraham</hi> is held forth to us a Pattern of Faith, ſo he may be to us a Pattern of worſhip, in as much as all true worſhip to God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Faith, by Faith in Chriſt; Such apprehenſions thererefore <hi>Abraham</hi> had of God in his worſhip, ſuch apprehenſions of God we are to have in our worſhip; and as <hi>Abraham</hi> had thoſe conceptions of God by Faith in Chriſt, ſo can we have the like conceptions of God by Faith in Chriſt only.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:46545:214"/>1. Thoſe apprehenſions <hi>Abraham</hi> had of God did beget (as we have ſhewn) high thoughts of God, with ſuch apprehenſions of God we muſt perfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Low thoughts of God will ever perform but low, baſe, contemptible Service and Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>Now ſuch high thoughts and conceptions of God with which all our Worſhip muſt be performed to him, can ſpring only from the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God in Chriſt, who is the higheſt Revelation of the glory of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.5. The brightneſs, the effulgency of his glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. When God had yielded to give <hi>Moſes</hi> a ſight of his glory, he put him into the Cliſt of the Rock (which was a<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Rainolds,</hi> Pſa. 110. p. 166</note> reſemblance of Chriſt, as a Learned Divine hath obſerved) and ſo made his glory to paſs before him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.22. Certainly, <hi>Moſes</hi> had here a ſight of Gods glory beyond all that ever he had ſeen before. Compare with this that Text, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God, who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of his glory in the face of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt:</hi> All the other manifeſtations of Gods glory were but dark and dim, in compariſon of thoſe which appear in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore we can att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in no where ſuch high, ſo great, ſo glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of God as in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſuch Conceptions of God as humbled, emptied, and abaſed him in himſelf in compariſon of God; and with ſuch apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God muſt we perform all our Worſhip to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6.

            <p>Now ſuch Conceptions of God, which above all others humble, and leſſen, and abaſe the Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is the general opinion of the Schoolmen, that the Angels in the firſt inſtant of their Creation did not enjoy that ſight of God we call
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:46545:215"/> 
               <hi>Beatifical Viſion,</hi> and that the Angels that fell never had ſight of it at all, for if they had, they could not have fallen. But what they talk of the good Angels meriting that Beatifical Viſion of God in the ſecond or third inſtant of their Creation, is Popiſh foppery; Divines unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly attribute their ſtation and ſtability in holineſs to Jeſus Chriſt: We may upon good grounds alſo attribute to Jeſus Chriſt their firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the preſence, ſight, enjoyment of God, their ſtate of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural bleſſedneſs. Pardon this digreſſion; it is to make the way clear for the demonſtration in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Angels before they had a ſight of God, or of themſelves in Chriſt, many of them waxed proud and fell; the ſame pride that ruined ſome might have ruined all; but after they had a ſight of God in Chriſt, how humble were they? That Viſion ſpoken of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1, 2. was manifeſtly an appearance of the glory of God in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>I ſaw the Lord upon his Throne, high and lifted up, and his Train filled the Temple;</hi> what the carriage of the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims was towards God in this his appearance is expreſt, <hi>Each one had ſix wings, with twain they did fly;</hi> noting their ready execution of Gods Commands: <hi>with twain they did cover their faces;</hi> noting their natural impotency in themſelves to behold the ſurpaſſing brightneſs of Divine Glory; <hi>with twain they covered their feet,</hi> as humbled in the ſenſe and ſhame of their own Creature imperfection in compariſon of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite purity and holineſs of God.</p>
            <p>Thus, when <hi>Moſes</hi> had had a ſight of the glory of God in Chriſt, <hi>He made haſte, he bowed his head toward the earth and worſhipped.</hi> Exod. 34.8. Quickly is the ſoul humbled at the manifeſtations of God in Chriſt. In Chriſt we have ſeen God humbling, emptying, leſſening, diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf for us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7. Who can be proud that hath had a true ſight of God humbled for him?</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of God in Chriſt are begotten the deepeſt ſoul humiliations for ſin; Zach. 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look on Me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him — and they ſhall be in bitterneſs for him</hi> — This great ſorrow was not for the piercing of the Humanity of Chriſt barely conſidered; but for piercing God in Chriſt, though the Godhead was not in the leaſt paſſive; therefore that bloud which was ſhed is called, <hi>The bloud of God, Acts</hi> 20.28. and that perſon who was pierced called, <hi>The Lord of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. Sins againſt the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Love, Mercy, Grace, Compaſſions, Goodneſs, and Glory of God in Chriſt beget the deepeſt humiliation of ſoul in all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſuch Conceptions of God as did repreſent him
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:46545:215"/> gracious, propitious, benevolous to the Creature, a bountiful rewarder of him that ſerveth him, notwithſtanding the greatneſs of God, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of the Creature.</p>
            <p>Such apprehenſions we muſt have of God in all our approaches to him, in all our performances of duty and worſhip.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Cain</hi> could not apprehend ſo much favour and grace in God as could pardon his ſin and remove his puniſhment he then went out from the preſence of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13.16. That is (as Interpreters of good note render it) he left the Church of God in his Fathers Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Worſhip of God, the Ordinances of God, the ſervice of God, the profeſſion of God and all: Such as cannot have apprehenſions of God as gracious, propitious, will not come into the preſence of God.</p>
            <p>Nor ſuch as cannot apprehend him a bountiful rewarder of them that come to him; They bid God depart from them who queſtion whether God can do any thing for them, or whether there be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in his ſervice, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14, 15. and <hi>Job</hi> 22.17. when thoſe mercenary hypocrites had loſt their worldly profits &amp; preferments which they had gained by the profeſſion of Religion, when the tide was turned, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanneſs only countenanced, they caſt off all, and ſaid, <hi>It is in vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances,</hi> Mal. 3.14, 15.</p>
            <p>But he that cometh to God muſt have ſuch apprehenſions of him as render him Gracious as well as Glorious, Merciful as well as Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for we come to God ſitting on his Throne of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> and we have to deal with mercy for ſupply to all our needs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11.6.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he moſt bountiful Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; So Chriſt tells his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.26. <hi>If any man ſerve me, let him follow me, and where I am there ſhall my ſervant be alſo: If any man ſerve me, him ſhall my Father honour;</hi> We ſerve the Father in ſerving the Son; never was ſervice rewarded with ſuch honour; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>The Father himſelf loveth you becauſe ye have loved me, and believed that I am ſent of God,</hi> Joh. 16.27.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſuch apprehenſions of God as did beget a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table perſwaſion of faith for his acceptation with God in that his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to him.</p>
            <p>It is the mind of God that ſuch as come to him ſhould have ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of him as one that will accept them, embrace them, when he diſcovers nothing but wrath and diſpleaſure againſt them that ſtand in oppoſition againſt him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.4, 5. <hi>Fury is not in me: Let a man take hold of my ſtrength that he may make peace with me, and he ſhall make peace with me;</hi> That holy man knew that all his happineſs conſiſted in the enjoyment of God, therefore he ſaid, <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God;</hi> but was he ſure God would accept him? <hi>I have put my truſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Lord God, Pſal.</hi> 73.27, 28.</p>
            <p>Now ſuch apprehenſions of God as beget a faith of acceptation with God in our approaches to him, can ſpring only from the manifeſtations of God to us in Chriſt; that is ſuppoſed (by judicious Interpreters) to be ſpoken of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. who is ſaid to engage his heart to approach unto the Lord; and God ſaith, <hi>I will cauſe him to draw near, and he ſhall approach unto me;</hi> Chriſt hath boldneſs and liberty, full ſecurity of acceptation with God; and hereby he hath procured us liberty, boldneſs, and acceptation with God; Heb. 4.14, 16. <hi>Seeing we have a great high Prieſt paſſed into the Heavens — Let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace.</hi> Heb. 10.19, 21, 22. <hi>Having boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt — And having an high Prieſt over the Houſe of God; Let us draw nigh to God with truth of heart, and full aſſurance of faith,</hi> Ver. 2. For
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:46545:216"/> the acceptation of our perſons and ſervices. Eph. 3.12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence by the faith of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what hath been laid down we may conclude, That ſuch appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions or Conceptions of God wherewith we are to draw near to God, to perform every duty, and every part of Divine Worſhip muſt flow from the manifeſtations of God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               </gap>ject of all Goſpel-Worſhip: It was ſo under the Law in Types and Figures; and ſuch was the Tabernacle and Temple Worſhip in its ſpiritual Notion.</p>
            <p>The Tabernacle or Temple was Gods Habitation, or dwelling place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.2. There was the only place of Publick Worſhip, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.2.
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:46545:217"/> No Sacrifice was to be offered in any other place; There the Spiritual Worſhippers had by faith a ſight of God, and Communion with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.24. Towards God in this place they were to make all their Supplications and Prayers where ever, or in what Country ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.29, 30. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. Now the Tabernacle and Temple were a Type of the Body or Humanity of Chriſt, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf explaineth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. In which the Divine glory of the Godhead dwelt; <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word was made fleſh, and dwelt amongst us</hi> (or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacled in us, as the Greek word ſignifies) <hi>and we ſaw his Glory, the Glory as of the only begotten of the Father.</hi> Therefore what the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle or Temple was to them under the Law, that is Chriſt Jeſus to us under the Goſpel. And as God manifeſted to them in the Temple was the proper Object of Worſhip to them, ſo God manifeſted to us in Chriſt is the proper Object of Worſhip to us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Fleſh or Humanity of Chriſt is the <hi>Medium</hi> or Mean by which we have acceſs to God in all our Worſhip.

               </gap>rely conſidered as ſuch, but in that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it is to be underſtood, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53, 54, 55, 56. where Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of eating his Fleſh and drinking his Bloud unto life; where Chriſts Fleſh (by a Metonymy of the Cauſe for the Effect) ſignifies the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Satisfaction, Reconciliation, Grace, Peace, Glory Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for us by the obedience he performed to God in that Fleſh; By the Fleſh of Chriſt in this ſence we have acceſs to God in all our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>Yet is not the conſideration of Chriſts Natural Fleſh altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs unto this end; For whereas we are apt to frame Images and Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes of God in our minds, the right apprehenſions of God dwelling in the Humane Nature of Chriſt (who is the true Image of the Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God) may be effectual to remove all other Images and likeneſſes of God out of our minds: But then we muſt be careful that we do not terminate our conceptions of God in the Man-Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Byfield</hi> Comment on 1 Pet. 2.12. p. 410.</note> or in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> then we ſhall make the Humane Nature of Chriſt the Image of the Godhead, and that would be an Idol. But when we have taken up an apprehenſion of the Humanity of Chriſt, if our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions paſs through the vayl into the Holieſt; if we are led thereby to worſhip that Godhead that dwels in it, this is a right Conception, and true Worſhip.</p>
            <pb n="425" facs="tcp:46545:217"/>
            <p>The Humanity of Chriſt was to the Godhead as a back of metal to a Chriſtal Glaſs; Look on ſuch a glaſs in its pure ſubſtance and it is tranſparent, put a back of metal to it and it gives a beautiful reflex: So if we take up Conceptions of the Godhead in its pure Eſſence, it is tranſparent; If we conſider God Infinite, Almighty, Immenſe, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, what is this to the Creature, or our comfort? If we conſider him in his Power, Juſtice, Wiſdom, Holineſs, Goodneſs, Truth, what is this to us? Yea, all theſe are againſt us as we are ſinners; But if we take up Conceptions of God in all theſe Attributes as they appear to us in Chriſt, as they are backt with the Humanity of Chriſt, ſo they make a moſt comfortable reflex upon us; In this glaſs we behold the glory of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame ſimilitude from glory to glory by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. In this Glaſs we behold that Wiſdom by which we are inſtructed, that righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified, that power by which we are preſerved, that grace by which we are choſen and called, that goodneſs by which we are relieved and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that holineſs by which we are transformed, that glory to which we ſhall be conformed.</p>
            <p>The Concluſion of all this is, <hi>That our right apprehenſions and due Conceptions of God muſt ſpring from the manifeſtations of God in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <hi>degree</hi> and <hi>ſpece</hi> of it, of that I ſhall treat at this time, and my Note will be:</p>

               <hi>That distraction of thoughts, or the removing of the heart from God in Worſhip, is a great ſin, and degree of hypocriſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text ſpeaketh of <hi>groſs hypocriſie</hi> or a zealous pretence of outward Worſhip without any <hi>ſerious bent</hi> of heart towards God; but <hi>any removal</hi> of the heart from him in times neceſſary to think of him is a degree of it; for though <hi>diſtractions in Worſhip</hi> are incident to the people of God, yet they are culpable, and do ſo far argue the <hi>relicks of hypocriſie</hi> in them.

            </p>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That there is ſuch a ſin, ſad experiences witneſſeth, <hi>vain thoughts</hi> intrude importunately upon the ſoul in every duty, in <hi>hearing</hi> the word we are not free, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. nor in <hi>ſinging,</hi> but chiefly they haunt us in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and of all kinds of prayer in <hi>mental Prayer,</hi> when our addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God are managed by thoughts alone, there we are more eaſily diſturbed, words bound the thoughts and the inconvenience of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption is more ſenſible, as occaſioning a pauſe in our ſpeech; and as <hi>in mental Prayer,</hi> ſo when we <hi>joyn with others,</hi> to keep time and pace with their words, unleſs the Lord quicken them to an extraordinary livelineſs, we find it very hard, but how great a ſin this is, is my firſt task to ſhew. I ſhall do it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By three <hi>generall</hi> conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By ſpeaking <hi>particularly</hi> to the preſent caſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>Generally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider how <hi>tender God is of his Worſhip, Lev.</hi> 10.3. He hath ſaid, <hi>That he will be ſanctified in all that draw nigh unto him.</hi> To <hi>ſanctifie</hi> is to ſet apart from <hi>common uſe.</hi> Now God will be <hi>ſanctified,</hi> that is, not treated with as an ordinary perſon, but with ſpecial <hi>heedfulneſs</hi> of <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> becoming ſo <hi>great a Majeſty;</hi> when you think to put him off with any thing, you leſſen his excellency and greatneſs, and do not <hi>ſanctifie him,</hi> or <hi>glorifie him as God,</hi> and therefore God pleadeth his Majeſty when they would put a ſorry Sacrifice upon him, as if every thing were good enough for him. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Curſed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> To be ſleight in his ſervice argueth mean thoughts of God. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, nor haſty to utter any thing before God, for God is in heaven,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:46545:236"/> and thou upon earth.</hi> We forget our diſtance, and by a <hi>bold prophaneneſs</hi> are too <hi>fellow-like</hi> and <hi>familiar</hi> with God, when we are not <hi>deeply ſerious</hi> and <hi>exact</hi> in what we do and ſay in his preſence, but only babble over a few impertinent words without <hi>attention</hi> and <hi>affection:</hi> Certainly, God is very ſenſible of the wrong and contempt we put upon him, for he noteth all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>All things are naked and open to him with whom we have to do.</hi> And he will not put it up, for he telleth us, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8. <hi>That he will not hold them guiltleſs that take his Name in vain;</hi> and he will be as good as his word: For the leaſt diſorders in Worſhip have been ſorely puniſhed, witneſs the <hi>ſtroke from heaven</hi> upon <hi>Aarons Sons, Lev.</hi> 10.2. The <hi>breach</hi> made upon <hi>Uzzah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.6. And the havock made of the <hi>Bethſhemites,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. The <hi>diſeaſes</hi> that raged at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. And though judgments be not ſo riſe and viſible now upon our unhallowed approaches to God, yet he ſmiteth us with <hi>deadneſs</hi> where he doth not ſmite us with <hi>death,</hi> for a <hi>man</hi> is puniſhed otherwiſe than a <hi>boy,</hi> and judgments are now <hi>ſpiritual</hi> which in the Infancy of the Church were <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>bodily.</hi> Certainly, we have all cauſe to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when we come before the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The more ſincere any one is, the more he maketh conſcience of his thoughts,</hi> is more <hi>obſervant</hi> of them, and more <hi>troubled</hi> about them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the unrighteous man forſake his thoughts;</hi> then he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be ſerious, and to have a conſcience indeed when his thoughts trouble him. So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.113. <hi>I hate vain thoughts, but thy Law do I love.</hi> We think thoughts are <hi>free</hi> and ſubject to no Tribunal, if there be any errour in them, we think it is a very <hi>venial</hi> one, they betray us to no <hi>ſhame</hi> in the world, and therefore we let them go without <hi>diſlike</hi> and <hi>remorſe:</hi> But a child of God cannot paſs over the matter ſo, he knoweth that thoughts are the <hi>immediate births</hi> of the ſoul, and do much diſcover the temper of it; that there <hi>Actions</hi> begin, and if <hi>vain thoughts</hi> be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lodge in him, he will ſoon fall into further miſchief, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he conſidereth what he <hi>thinketh,</hi> as well as what he <hi>ſpeaketh</hi> and <hi>doth;</hi> and if at all times, eſpecially in Worſhip, where the workings of the inward man are of chief regard, and the acts of the outward only required, as a help to our <hi>ſerving God in the Spirit, Phil.</hi> 3.3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Careleſneſs in Duties is the high way to Atheiſm.</hi> For every <hi>formall</hi> and <hi>ſleight Prayer</hi> doth harden the heart, and make way for contempt of God; Men that have made <hi>bold with God</hi> in duty, and it ſucceeds well with them, their awe of God is leſſened, and the lively ſenſe of his Glory and Majeſty abated, till it be quite loſt; by degrees they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow <hi>all feelings</hi> and <hi>tenderneſs of conſcience,</hi> every time you come to
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:46545:237"/> God ſleightly you loſe ground by coming, till at length you look upon Worſhip as a <hi>meer Cuſtome,</hi> or ſomething done for faſhions ſake.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Particularly.</hi> 1. It is <hi>an affront to God,</hi> and a kind of <hi>moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery;</hi> we wrong his <hi>Omniſciency,</hi> as if he ſaw not the heart, and could not tell man his thought. It is Gods Eſſential glory in Worſhip to be acknowledged an <hi>all-ſeeing Spirit,</hi> and accordingly to be worſhipped in <hi>ſpirit and in truth, Joh.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Thoughts</hi> are as audible with him as <hi>words,</hi> therefore when you <hi>prattle words,</hi> &amp; do not make conſcience of <hi>thoughts,</hi> you do not worſhip him <hi>as a ſpirit.</hi> We wrong <hi>his Majeſty</hi> when we ſpeak to him in Prayer and do not give heed to what we ſay; ſurely we are not to prattle <hi>like Jayes,</hi> or <hi>Parrots,</hi> words without affection and feeling, or to <hi>chatter like Cranes,</hi> or be like <hi>Ephraim</hi> whom the Prophet calls a <hi>ſilly Dove without an heart.</hi> A mean man taketh it ill when you have buſineſs to talk with him about, and your minds are elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; you would all judge it to be an affront to the Majeſty of God if a man ſhould ſend his <hi>cloaths ſtuffed with ſtraw,</hi> or a <hi>Puppet</hi> dreſſed up inſtead of himſelf into the Aſſemblies of Gods people, and think this ſhould ſupply his <hi>perſonal preſence,</hi> yet our cloaths ſtuffed with ſtraw, or an Image dreſſed up inſtead of us, ſuch as<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 19.12, 13.</note>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1.

It is to be reckoned among the <hi>infirmities of the Saints,</hi> which do not hinder their Conſolation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is <hi>diſtractio negligens, a negligent diſtraction.</hi> When a man hath an intention to pray, and expreſs his deſires to God, but he <hi>prays careleſly,</hi> and doth not guard his thoughts, ſo that <hi>ſometimes</hi> he <hi>wanders,</hi> and <hi>ſometime recovers himſelf again,</hi> and then <hi>ſtraies again,</hi> and is <hi>in</hi> and <hi>out, off</hi> and <hi>on</hi> with God: as a <hi>Spaniel</hi> roveth up and down, and is ſtill croſſing the waies, ſometimes loſing the company he goes with, and then retiring to them again. I cannot ſay, this man <hi>prayeth not at all,</hi> or that God doth not <hi>hear him,</hi> but he will have <hi>little comfort</hi> in his Prayers; yea, if he be ſerious they will miniſter more matter of <hi>grief</hi> to him than <hi>comfort;</hi> and therefore he ought to be more <hi>earneſt</hi> and <hi>ſedulous</hi> in <hi>reſiſting</hi> this <hi>infirmity,</hi> that he may be aſſured of audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Otherwiſe, if his heart be not affected with it in time, by degrees all <hi>thoſe motions</hi> and <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> of heart that are neceſſary to prayer will be <hi>eaten out</hi> and <hi>loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is <hi>diſtractio voluntaria, a voluntary diſtraction;</hi> when men mind no more than the <hi>task</hi> or <hi>work wrought,</hi> and only go round in a <hi>track of accuſtomed duties,</hi> without conſidering with what heart they

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The cauſes of this <hi>roving</hi> and impertinent intruſion of vain thoughts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sathan</hi> is one cauſe, who doth <hi>Maxime inſidiari orationibus</hi> (as <hi>Caſſian</hi> ſpeaketh) lye in wait to hinder the Prayers of the Saints, when ever we <hi>miniſter before the Lord,</hi> he is at our <hi>right hand ready to reſiſt us, Zech.</hi> 3.1.

Implying thereby, That there is no <hi>drawing nigh</hi> to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>reſiſting Sathan.</hi> When a <hi>Tale</hi> is told, and you are going about the <hi>Affairs of the World,</hi> he doth not trouble you, for theſe things do not trouble him, or do any prejudice to his Kingdom: But when you are going to God, and that in a <hi>warm, lively affectionate manner,</hi> he will be ſure to diſturbe you, ſeeking to abate the <hi>edge of your affections,</hi> or <hi>divert your minds;</hi> Formal Prayers <hi>patterd</hi> over do him no harm, but when you ſeriouſly ſet your ſelves to call upon God, he ſaith within himſelf, This man will pray <hi>for Gods Glory,</hi> and then I am at a loſſe; for the <hi>coming of Christs Kingdom,</hi> and then mine goeth to wrack; <hi>That Gods Will may be done upon earth as it is in heaven,</hi> and that minds me of my <hi>old fall,</hi> and my buſineſs is to croſs the Will of God; he will pray <hi>for dayly bread,</hi> and that ſtrengtheneth dependance for <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> and then I loſe ground, for the devils are the<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 6, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Rulers of the darkneſs of this World;</hi> He will pray to be kept <hi>from ſin</hi> and <hi>temptation,</hi> and that is againſt me. Thus <hi>Sathan</hi> is <hi>afraid</hi> of the Prayers of the Saints, he is concerned in <hi>every requeſt</hi> you make to God, and therefore he will <hi>hinder</hi> or <hi>cheat</hi> you of your Prayers; if you will needs be praying, he will carry away your he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="2">II. In the Reaſon we have three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>ground</hi> of the duty, it is <hi>the will of God,</hi> the revealed will of God, the rule of all obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The manner of declaring Gods will to us in this behalf, it is the <hi>will of God in Christ Jeſus;</hi> it is a Goſpel duty, Chriſt Jeſus was the Prophet and Meſſenger of it, it's ſutable to the minde of Chriſt, it's accepted of God in Chriſt and for Chriſt. Laſtly, Chriſt himſelf was a pattern of it, This is the will of God <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſpecially Application, This is the <hi>will of God</hi> in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <hi>concerning you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> doth excellently ſhew the ſweet harmony between theſe three duties, how one helps the other; but I cannot inſiſt on that.</p>
            <p>The leſſon then which the holy Ghoſt would have us learn in the Text, is thus ſum'd up:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus concerning Chriſtians, that in every thing they give thanks, that they be thankefull,</hi> as our word is more proper to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>For though we have nothing of our own that good is to give God but <hi>thanks,</hi> yet neither do we properly give him that,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.7. 1 Chro. 29.14. Philip. 2, 13.</note> ſeeing both our <hi>giving</hi> and the right <hi>manner</hi> of doing it, even in thankſgiving is of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Our continual praying ſhews that we are alwaies <hi>beggars,</hi> and our continual thankſgiving ſhews us alwaies <hi>debtors.</hi> Our thanks then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the rebound of mercy heavenward whence it came, and a holy reflexion of the warm ſun-beams of Gods benefits ſhining on us.</p>
            <p>That which I principally aim at in the purſuance and preſſing of this Truth, is, not only to ſpeak ſomewhat to it in the nature, neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and excellency of it, but to the extent of it as a ſpecial Caſe, <hi>How Chriſtians may be ſaid to give thanks in every thing, and why?</hi>

            <p>Some are ſo curious as to enquire whether reprobates in hell have not cauſe to give thanks that their torments are leſſe then the merit of their ſins, and for that the juſtice of God is glorified in the inflicting of them, but this is forrain to our caſe.</p>

            <p>But when the Lord is inquired of for the things we have, and doth grant them <hi>to us,</hi> this is a bleſſing, upon his own inſtitution, and a ſeal to his promiſe; hear <hi>David,</hi>

            <p n="5">V. <hi>When any of Gods dealings do either draw us or drive us nearer to God, this is a special mercy.</hi> When we conſider that well, we cannot but be greatly affected with it, and will be accordingly thankful for the mercy, or the diſpenſation is thereby the more merciful: mercies are drawing cords, afflictions are whipcords, to drive us; by both we are brought nearer to God, thank him.</p>
            <p>If the chief Shepherd hunt us together, and keep us from ſtragling, and bring us under command, this is a mercy to Chriſts ſheep. If the Lord <hi>hedg up our wayes with thorns</hi> that we cannot find our lovers,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.6. verſ. 8, 9.</note> this is a mercy.</p>
            <p>And if the Lord recover his mercies from us, that in the want of them we may know he was the Founder and Fountain of them, this is a mercy.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Abſolom</hi> burnt <hi>Joab</hi>'s corn, it was to make <hi>Joab</hi> (who before that <hi>kept off</hi>) come to him.<note place="margin">Amos 4:6, <hi>to</hi> v. 12.</note> So all the angry diſpenſations of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his children are that they return to him.</p>

            <p n="6">VI. <hi>That Soul that is truely, and ſpiritually thankful, will ſo order his whole converſation, that God may have the glory of it.</hi> This the Pſalmiſt who was well skild in this Art, ſeems to point at often. <hi>Who ſo offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth praiſe glorifieth me,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We cannot better glorifie God than by a well-ordered converſation, this is in every thing to give thanks indeed. So likewiſe in praiſe the Lord,<note place="margin">Pſa. 106.1, 2, 3.</note>

            <p>Now this no man can do neither perfectly, but only by the merits and in the ſtrength of Chriſt, he making it the deſire of his ſoul to ſerve the Lord it is accepted, though endeavours fall ſhort, and therefore is pronounced bleſſed.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that in nothing will give thanks, at no time, for no mercy; theſe are ſwine that devour all that drops from the Tree of Gods bounty, and never look up whence it cometh. Theſe are worſe than the <hi>Oxe</hi> and <hi>Aſs that know their Owners and Maſters cribs.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Another kind of unthankful men is that ſort, who having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mercies from God arrogate the honour of them to themſelves.</p>

            <p n="2">II.

            <p n="1">1. Spiritual Sloth is threefold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reſolving Sloth. 2. Delaying Sloth. 3. Diſturbing Sloth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reſolving Sloth, is, when a Soul is ſetled upon it's lees, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to lie ſtill, and never to ſtir in that momentous concernment of its own eternal Salvation. <hi>Solomon</hi> excellently deciphers this, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.14. <hi>As the door turns upon his hinges, ſo doth the ſlothful upon his bed;</hi> as the door turns upon the hinges, and never ſtirs from his place, ſo the ſlothful turns upon the bed of ſecurity, and never turns from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.16, 17. they were reſolved to worſhip the Queen of Heaven, come life, come death. Such was the Souldiers reſolution, who had on his Target God and the Devil pictured, under God <hi>ſi tu non vìs,</hi> under the Devil <hi>iſte rogitat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Delaying Sloth, when a perſon doth intend to look after Soul-concernments, but not yet, they will borrow day, a little time. Much like that ſluggard, Prov. 6.10. <hi>Yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:46545:255"/> folding of the hands to ſleep.</hi> When the ſluggard is cal'd to ariſe in the morning, he reſolves to do it, only intreats one little, one ſhort nap more, and then he will ariſe. So when ſome are called to awaken, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and walk with God in his way in the morning of their age, they crave one ſhort nap more firſt, and then they will do it; give them leave to get ſuch an eſtate, to obtain ſuch an honour, to match ſuch a child, to ſatisfie ſuch a luſt, and then will they be for God. Such a ſluggard was <hi>Auſtin,</hi> a little longer, O Lord, a little longer, preſently, preſenly. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.10.<note place="margin">Paululum, pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulum, modo &amp; modo, &amp; hoc erat ſine modo. <hi>Aug.</hi> lib. confeſſ. <hi>Plutarch.</hi> in Moral.</note> the five fooliſh Virgins reſolved to have oyl in their lamps and veſſels, only they would take a nod. Oh how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is delaying Sloth? the Virgins deferring, provokes Chriſt to denying. <hi>Archias</hi> being merry at ſupper, had a letter ſent him that concern'd his life, and though deſired to read it, puts it up into his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I'l mind ſerious things to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but he lived not unto the morrow, to mind thoſe ſerious things. Such another ſluggard was the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. <hi>Stulte hac nocte. Tolle moras: ſemper nocuit differre paratis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lucan.</note> 
               <hi>Alexander</hi> being asked how he came to conquer the World, replied, <hi>Nunquam differre volens;</hi> if you will overcome more than <hi>Alexander</hi> did, not only the World, but alſo Sathan, and your own fleſh, the worſt and ſtrongeſt enemy of all, you muſt carefully lay hold on every lock of opprotunity, and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly improve the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Diſturbing Sloth is, when a perſon doth intend and endeavour to walk in Gods way, but Sloth as ruſt hinders the wheels of his Soul from coming to, and running in the way of God. The <hi>Torpedo</hi> if it touch but any part of the angle that a man holds in his hand,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin.</hi> nat. hiſt. lib. <hi>32.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>corpus torpeſcere facit,</hi> it benums and ſtupifies all the members that they cannot ſtir or ſtrive. Such malignant influence hath. Sloth upon the Soul; the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of Saints Souls ſhould drive as <hi>Jehu's</hi> heartily and furiouſly, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.20. and not as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s chariots heavily and faintly, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.25. all the agility of the Soul, and all the ability of the body are required in Gods way, and about Gods work, whatſoever comes ſhort of this is Sloth, as whatſoever comes ſhort of Virtue is Vice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Activity in duty is a victorious conqueſt over the Great <hi>Goliah</hi> Sloth, and riding triumph in the way, work, and worſhip of God; activity is a <hi>David</hi>'s dancing before the Ark with all his might; there are three things which concur and contribute to complete this activity in duty.</p>

            <p n="1">1. A ſtreining and ſtretching of the ſoul to the utmoſt peg, and higheſt pin, a putting of it upon the tenter-hooks in ſervice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An unſatiable and unſatisfiable deſire or longing for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and accompliſhing of a duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

If you will lend me your <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> I will give you my <hi>pains</hi> in reſolving this weighty and worthy caſe of Conſcience, <hi>how a Chriſtian may know, whether his activity in duty be from the Spirit of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall commend to you theſe eight Characteriſtical Notes as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Touch-ſtones.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When we have beforehand earneſtly praied and prepared our ſouls for ſuch activity, when you ſay and do to your ſoul, as <hi>Jehu</hi> did to the worſhippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> 2. Kings 10.19. I have a great Sacrifice to offer O my ſoul, warn and ſummon in all the powers and parts of ſoul and body, be ſure that not one be wanting, and ſo by reading, meditating and Prayer get our ſouls into a holy frame and gratious poſture; and humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea heartily alſo beg and beſeech of God, to carry us on Eagles wings through the duty we are drawing near to, if we mount and ſoar aloft as <hi>(Aquilae in nubibus)</hi> Eagles to Heaven in that duty, we may ſafely and ſurely conclude that activity is from the Spirit. When Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners buy a wind of the Witches (as they do in <hi>Lapland</hi> and other places) and they have it at every place and point, according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the one, and the promiſe of the other, they may undoubtedly conclude that wind came from the ſpirit of the Devil. When we beg a wind from God and we enjoy it at the time according to our deſire, we may upon good ground ſay, that wind came from the Spirit of God; this will appear very clear if you pleaſe to lay together theſe four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is Gods Prerogative to hear Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. <hi>Oh thou that heareſt Prayer, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is Gods Promiſe to hear Praier, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10. <hi>Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it;</hi> ſpread thy ſails by Prayer, and I will fill them by my Spirit, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>He will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is Gods uſual courſe to perform his Promiſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in that very kind, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Lord, thou haſt heard the deſire of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:46545:264"/> thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cauſe thine eare to hear. I ſaid not to the ſeed of Jacob, ſeek ye me in vain,</hi> Iſa. 45.19.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It hath been the conſtant practiſe of Gods people to look after their Praiers, to ſee what ſucceſſe they have had. Prayers come not out of the Ark of their ſouls, as the Raven did, never to return, but as <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, to come back again with an Olive branch into the ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his Saints.</hi> Saints do not ſhoot the arrows of their Prayers as children do, ſhoot them away and never mind them, but as Archers that ſhoot their arrows up into the air, and ſtand expecting their returns down again; if our activity come from the return of Prayers, it muſt be from the Spirit. When <hi>Elias</hi> prayes ſo fervently, that fire might come down from Heaven, and conſume the ſacrifice, and it did ſo, the people might juſtly cry out, <hi>the Lord he is God, the Lord he is God,</hi> 1 Kings 18.37, 39. So when we pray for fire and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to come down from Heaven on our ſervice, and it comes, we may cry, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When our activity carries us <hi>ſupra ſphaeram activitatis,</hi> above the reach of any creature; when duſt is carried up on high the wind does it, when duſt and aſhes are carried up on high in a duty, the wind of the Spirit does it; If a Chymiſt diſſolves a ſtone into drops of water, we may be ſure ſome help higher than a creature hath helped him. If a heart of ſtone ſhall be diſſolved into drops of water in a duty, it muſt be ſome help higher than a creatures muſt do it; if <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymedes</hi> be carried up to heaven, it muſt be by the help of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> if the ſoul be carried up to Heaven ſo in a duty (that an extaſie rather than an activity) it is by the help of the Spirit; if our ſpirit cries in a duty with ſighs and groans that are unutterable, it was enabled by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. when we are carried through difficulties, doubts, duties, dangers, that ſeem impoſſible, impaſſible, by reaſon of the Lyons in the way, and the Lyons in the ſtreets, that ſtand open-mouthed to devour us, <hi>Pro.</hi> 26.13. Then to venture through all, fire, fury, faggot, this is of the Spirit of God. When <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue active in Prayer three times a day, with his windows open, that all might ſee him, when there were Lyons in the way indeed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. When <hi>Luther</hi> in outward ſtreights ſhall have ſuch inward enlargements that he comes off from his knees, with a <hi>vicimus, vicimus.</hi> When he ſhall go to <hi>Worms</hi> to own the truth of Chriſt, though all the tiles upon the houſes were devils. Of theſe Prayers, and Practices, and ſuch like, we may ſay, as <hi>Protogenes</hi> of a curious Line, none but <hi>Apelles</hi> could
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:46545:265"/> draw this, none but the Spirit of God could enlarge and enable to do this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When we feel and find our hearts after duty ſilled and fraighted with ſpiritual joyes, and heavenly comforts; when our ſoul is like a Merchants ſhip returned from the <hi>Indies</hi> loaden as deep as it can ſwim, with all variety of Spices, and precious Commodities; When we have ſuch inward raviſhings that our heart is a little Heaven, fill'd up to the brim with joy, as our Saviour prayed for us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.11. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying that joy unſpeakable and full of glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. Heaven an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidated, or Heaven before-hand; when we have that joy which is the earneſt of Gods love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> (in this life) <hi>for them that love him;</hi> but God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit. This joy is not only the fulfilling of Chriſts Prayer, but alſo the fruit of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. When the King had brought his Spouſe into his Bride-chamber after her prayer, he raviſhes her heart with joy, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. When <hi>David</hi> had been at Prayer, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon me:</hi> Then comes that rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart more than in the time that their Corn, and Wine, and Oyl encreaſed,</hi> Pſal. 4.6, 7. When we have greater joy after duty than Worldlings have after Harveſt, which is their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt joy, <hi>gaudium meſſis,</hi> is <hi>meſſis gaudiu;</hi> The joy of their harveſt is all the harveſt of their joy, which this Worlds Earth-worms are likely to enjoy, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Son, remember that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things,</hi> ſaies <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. When our activity in duty is conſtant, like the motion of the fire in its Orb (which Philoſophers tell us) is perpetual. <hi>My ſoul brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times,</hi> Pſal. 119.20. The Spirit dwels in us as his Temple, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. The body is the Temple, the Soul the Late, the Affections the Strings, the Holy Ghoſt the Muſician, who in all our duties makes melody in our hearts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. Where the Ship is alway ſayling, the Wind is alway blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and we are ſure that ſayling comes from the Wind; if the Wind lies ſtill, the Ship lies ſtill, is becalmed. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, freedom and liberty are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to three things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Neceſſity. 2. Co-action. 3. Reſtraint. Now the Spirit of God ſets our heels <hi>(ut aiunt)</hi> our hearts at liberty, not only from neceſſity, co-action, but alſo reſtraint. Setting at liberty is freeing us from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and giving freedom to go whither we will. The Spirit
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:46545:265"/> admits us to that liberty which is 1. The purchaſe of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. 2. The Priviledge of our filiation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21.<note place="margin">Per nomen li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatis, non tantum intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a peccati &amp; carnis ſervitute manumiſſionem.

               </note> 
               <hi>The glorious liberty of the Sons of God;</hi> The Spirit makes us act as it ſelf; <hi>Neſcit tarda moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina ſpiritus ſancti gratia.</hi> Ambr. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>The Spirit quickneth,</hi>

               </gap>, makes lively, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. As the Spirit of life frees us from the law of ſin and death, ſo from the Law of ſloth and deadneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome poor ſoul cries out, <hi>Woe is me, I am undone, I find none of this Spirit in me. I am none of thoſe fixed Stars about the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, that move many Millions in an hour, but a ſlow-paced Planet, that finiſhes not his courſe in many years, whoſe motion is ſo dull that not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Sure I am caſt out of the firmament of Gods favour, and ſhall be a wandring Star,</hi> to whom is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the miſery of Miniſters, that they cannot ſpeak of the experimental ſublimities of ſome, but others are preſently deſponding and deſpairing. I would not for a world quench the ſmoaking flax, or break the bruiſed reed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.20. Yea, I would with all my ſoul put the lambs in my boſome which cannot go, or but ſlowly; and gently lead them that are with young, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. I ſpeak this to them that are upon the ſtaves of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder in their aſcending to heaven, to be a loadſtone to draw them up, not a milſtone to drag them down. But to anſwer more appoſitely.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I intend it in oppoſition to them who live in a courſe of ſin, yet now and then in a duty do feel a fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. I lay it down a poſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ve ſign and <hi>incluſivè;</hi> that thoſe, and all thoſe that have conſtant activities, (though differing for the altitudes and degrees) may be certain of the Spirit, as thoſe that have Trade winds from Port to Port may be ſure they ſail by the wind; or as thoſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t have the Organ, <hi>medium,</hi> and object rightly diſpoſed, may be ſure they ſee. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells a ſtory of an old man, that alwaies aroſe from duty with theſe words,<note place="margin">Claudimini ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li mei, claudimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Be you ſhut, O my eyes, be ſhut, for I ſhall never behold any fairer Object than Gods face, which I have now beheld.</hi> But not a negative ſign <hi>excluſivè,</hi> as if thoſe (that repent of ſin, meditate on the Promiſes, poure out Prayers, walk with God, wait on Ordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. There are four things belong to a Chriſtian: 1. A habit. 2. An
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:46545:266"/> Act. 3. Degrees of that Act. 4. Senſe of all theſe. He may have the three firſt, and yet want the ſenſe of them. A ſhip may ſail, and yet the Mariner not ſenſible of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is no Rule but hath ſome Exception, no Experience in one Believers heart but a contrary Experience may be found in anothers. Various are the workings of Gods Spirit in the heart, he blows when, where, how he pleaſes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. He is called <hi>ſeven ſpirits, Rev.</hi> 1.4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his various influences. He doth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, blow in a duty, if the ſhip be ready, but to ſhew he is <hi>agens liberrimum,</hi> he will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſuſpend his Act, and leave the common Road. To conclude this, take this counſel, <hi>Stay thy ſelf upon thy God,</hi> Iſa. 50.10. Remembring he will ſend forth judgment unto victory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.20. And take this for a Cordial, which is a ſpiritual Riddle, <hi>It is a comfort to have no comfort;</hi> The deſires of ſome are as acceptable to God, as the deeds of others.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When we are enlarged, and yet we are not elated; high in Gods Spirit, low in our own ſpirit. True Chriſtians are like Canes, the fuller they are of Sugar, the lower they bend. <hi>Quanto ſublimior, tanto ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſior;</hi> The loftier, the lowlier. Every true Saints Motto: True activity is not Leaven to puff us up, but Lead to pull us down. What <hi>Bede</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſome to obſerve of <hi>Auſtine</hi> the Monk, ſent over a Legate from the Pope to his Brethren the Prelates and Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> I may advice you to obſerve, that if he carried himſelf humbly he came from the Lord; high in duty, and humble after duty comes from the Lord. When <hi>David</hi> and his people had been on the Mount in their offerings to the building of the Temple, ſee what a low Valley they are in the opinion of themſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="6">6. When activity in duty is expreſſed in activity in doing; when active Prayers are turned into active Practiſes.<note place="margin">Aeni. Syl. <hi>li. 2. Com.</hi> Promptiores ſunt homines promittendo quam exequin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. <hi>Dion. l. 38.</hi>

            <p n="7">7. When we give God the glory of all our Actings and activities. if it be returned to his praiſe, it was received from his Spirit. When Rivers return to the Sea, it argues they from thence proceeded, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.7. When <hi>David</hi> and his people had ſhewed their activity in their Preſent towards the erecting of the Temple, they ſhut up all with a moſt gracious and grateful Doxology, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.13. <hi>Now therefore our God, we thank thee, and praiſe thy glorious name,</hi> Pſal. 115.1. <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us but unto thy name give the glory.</hi> He doubles <hi>non nobis,</hi> to lay down man, to lift up God.

In all our comforts there is a forbidden fruit, which ſeemeth ſair, and taſteth ſweet, but which muſt not be touched.</p>
            <p>The Obſervations may be theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That all our actions naturall, in eating,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and civill, in buying and ſelling,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>come under a rule.</hi> This is implyed, elſe the Lord would not have brought thoſe great judgments on them, barely for their eating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had they not in thoſe imployments tranſgreſſed a rule.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such are uſually the miſcarriages of men in the uſe of lawfull things, that they are the procuring cauſes of the moſt dreadfull judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> For we ſee that the Lord makes mention of theſe very things lawfull in themſelves, as the cauſes of the floud on the world, and fire on <hi>Sodom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>The Lord puts great weight and ſtreſſe on thoſe very things which we take but little or no notice of.</hi> The old world and <hi>Sodom,</hi> little thought they ſhould come to ſo ſevere a reckoning for their eating and drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To bring things to an iſſue as to the caſe concerning our danger of ſin and miſcarriage in lawfull things; I ſhall 1. inquire <hi>When law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things become ſin to us.</hi> 2. <hi>How we may judg of our hearts and ſelves, and diſcern their miſcarriage and ſin in the purſuing, injoyment and uſe of lawfull things?</hi> 3. <hi>What are the ſins that attend the immoderate and inordinate uſe of lawfull things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt I anſwer, <hi>When lawfull comforts which are given us for helps, become hinderances in our way to Heaven, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſin to us.</hi> When we by our abuſive cleaving to the creature, by our inordinate affection to it, by our exorbitant diſorderly purſuing of it, doe abuſe our helps, they become hinderances to us, and as it was ſaid of <hi>Gideons</hi> Ephod, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.27. He made an Ephod, which
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:46545:268"/> when it became an Idol, became a ſnare. When lawfull comforts are immoderately and paſſionately deſired, purſued, enjoyed, then they become an Idol and a beloved, or at leaſt they become beloved ſo far as to carry it from Chriſt, from duty: Now when any thing becomes an Idol in the heart, ſo as that the ſoul begins to bow before it and yeild obedience to it, then it becomes an Idol, and what is an Idol in the heart, is a ſtumbling block of iniquity in our life, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.4. it is a ſtumbling block an hinderance in our way: ſuch Idols in the heart, uſually prove great offences, and both <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſtumbling blocks and occaſions of falling; the firſt ſignifies a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block to keep one off from duty; ſuch an offence <hi>Peter</hi> was to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.23. He would have hindred him in that great work which He had to do. The ſecond ſignifies a galltrapp which will vex and trouble one in duty: ſo that when our comforts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Idols, images of jealouſie in our hearts, then they are ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks, and ſo obſtacles in our way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Again, when our lawfull comforts by our dotage become be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds, or greatly, paſſionately beloved, then they become hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances; when your hearts inflame themſelves with your comforts, as the Lord ſpeaks of them <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.5. <hi>They inflamed themſelves with their Idols;</hi> when the heart doth inordinately love creature comforts, they are then turned into luſts, ſo that of lawfull comforts they are made unlawfull luſts, 1 <hi>Ioh</hi> 2.15, 16. the things of the world, or the profits, pleaſures, honours which uſually mens hearts and thoughts are taken up withall, are good and lawfull things in themſelves, but being abuſed, they are called, <hi>the lusts of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye,</hi> &amp;c. The Holy Ghoſt puts the luſt that is within us, to expreſſe the profits, pleaſures and honours of the world which are without us. So that the good things of this life, by our inordinate love to them being abuſed, the very nature and property of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>red, for inſtead of proving good helps to us when lawfully loved and uſed, become luſts that hinder us, for they fight againſt our ſouls, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. and members of the old man, and weapons in his hand to fight againſt God; they become one with old <hi>Adam</hi> in us, and therefore <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. we are bid to mortifie our earthly members; he doth not ſay, mortifie your luſts, but members, they being all one, and make up together body of ſin, one old man, as it is called <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22. Now it is certain that the old man in us, the body of ſin, is an enemy and a hinderance to us in our way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>In this caſe thoſe foul ſins of Idolatry and adultery are committed
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:46545:269"/> with the creature, in both which ſins the heart is ſtolen away from God, drawn away from the proper object. The Apoſtle uſeth that expreſſion <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.14. <gap reason="foreign">

They are joyned to Idols, fixed to them, ſo that as in Idolatry the heart is joyned to and fixed to the Idol, ſo as that it will not eaſily part with it, as it is <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.10. Has a nation changed its God, <hi>q. d.</hi> no they are fixed to their Gods and they will not change them. So it is in the ſin of adultery, the heart is ſtollen from the proper object; as it is <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. ſpeaking of wine and women, it is ſaid <hi>they ſteal away the heart,</hi> and it is glued to that which it goes a whoring after, ſo that it will not be taken off from it, <hi>Prov</hi> 2.9. When the creature becomes an Idol in the heart, then there is idolatry committed; and when it is a beloved there is adultery committed, the hope, and truſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the ſoul is gone, the love and care, the joy and delight of the ſoul is gone, and the ſoul with every creature that it thus enjoyes powreth out her fornications, as the Lord ſpake of them <hi>Ezek</hi> 16.5. and as they <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.17. are ſaid <hi>to commit fornication with all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> ſo a heart which inordinately loveth, and doteth on, and is glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to creature comforts, commits fornication and abomination with them.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond Inquiry was, <hi>How we may judg of our hearts, and know when they miſcarry and offend in the purſuing, uſe and enjoyment of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. When our deſire of, and our endeavours after worldly things grow ſtrong and vehement, and very eager and impatient; as <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid, <hi>Give me children or elſe I die,</hi> Gen. 30.1. When we begin to ſay, I muſt have ſuch an accommodation whatever it coſt me, I muſt have ſuch a comfort or I am undone: ſuch a purſuit after worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, argues a heart very carnall; and he that miſcarries ſo much in ſeeking after the things of this world, will not mend the matter much when he comes to enjoy them: when the heart groweth ſick after worldly things in the deſire of them, uſually it ſurfeteth when it gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it: as <hi>Amnon</hi> was ſick for his ſiſter, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.1, 2. he had a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet after: and as <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 King. 21.4. he was ſick with impatient earneſt longing for <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard. When your heart is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient till you doe obtain your deſires, you are never well with that thing which you do ſo obtain: When the affections grow ſtrong and warm, that you can indure no oppoſition or contradiction in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:46545:269"/> of your deſires, but you can bear any trouble or hardſhip that you may obtain the things deſired, as we ſee in <hi>Shechem,</hi> Gen. 34. who could endure circumciſion that he might have <hi>Dinah;</hi> and in <hi>Jacob,</hi> who did indure very much that he might have <hi>Rachel,</hi> Gen. 29.18. then there is a match towards, then in ſuch a caſe when it is gained, the heart becomes glued to it, and commits fornication with it, and cannot indure to be touched or thwarted in the fruition of it, as <hi>Demotrius</hi> and the Silver-ſmiths, when they found their <hi>Diana</hi> began to be touched by <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.24, 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they made an uproar, they would not endure that. When ye look on any thing with a greedy and impatient, longing, luſting eye, that, if you do obtain it (if God doth not otherwiſe order it) will prove a ſnare to you, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. an Idol, an image of jealouſie, a curſe and a croſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When you have raiſed expectations and hopes of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and ſatisfaction from your comforts: when you promiſe to your ſelves greater matters from the creature than it can yeeld, then you miſcarry when you look on the creature through the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying glaſſe of your affections and luſts, and ſee them as they are ſo repreſented bigger and better than they are, and from thence you have high valuation of them, and raiſed expectations alſo of great things from them: when we fancie an excellency in the creature that is not, we fancy a fullneſs in an empty thing, a ſatisfaction in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, unſatisfying comfort, we fancie a ſtability in a vain, fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vaniſhing thing: when we fancie a fountain exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llency in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ciſtern, as they did <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. then upon this the heart is raiſed to great expectations of pleaſure, profit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the heart ſhamefully miſcarries, and as it is ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3, 4. there is a ſtrange beaſt that turned the eyes of all the world after it; they looked with an eye of great expectation from this beaſt, and then they wondred and adored alſo; ſo that they looked with an eye of admiration and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the obedience and willing ſubmiſſion of the ſoul is brought off to any worldly comfort, and the ſoul ſtoops to its ſcepter, and the faculties like the Centurions ſervants doe as they are bid, ſuch comforts which are ſlaviſhly obeyed are ſinnefully enjoyed. When we are afraid to diſpleaſe them the fear is at command, when we are carefull to pleaſe ſuch a luſt, then the care is under ſubjection; when we are troubled if croſſed, then our ſorrow is at command; if rejoyced when that is gratified, then the love and delight of the ſoul
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:46545:270"/> are at command; <hi>And his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey,</hi> Rom. 6.16. When the ſoul is even as the ſervant that looks to the hand of the Maſter with an obediential eye, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 123.2. expecting a command, and ready to yeeld obedience, ſuch a comfort is a ſin and a curſe to you. Chriſt calls to us to deny our ſelves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. Profits, pleaſures, carnall advantages ſay, rather deny Chriſts command. Who is obeyed? Chriſt ſaith <hi>mortifie your luſts;</hi> luſt ſaith gratifie us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider who is obeyed? If family duties, and perſonall private duties; if praying, holy meditation, ſecret cloſe communion with God be neglected, becauſe multitude of worldly buſineſſe and full and great Trade in the world commands you another way, and requires the love, and zeal, and ſtrength, and care of the heart to another atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, then you are under another Sovereign than Chriſt. The obedience of the heart is carried to another Law, <hi>other Lords rule over you.</hi> Now the ſoul that is under the command of the creature, as I have ſhewed, that comfort becomes a ſin which uſurps the throne of the heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the ſoul groweth very tender and compaſſionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch a comfort, and begins to ſpare that above other things, then that becomes a luſt, and luſt is very tender and delicate, and muſt be tenderly uſed: right eyes are very tender, the leaſt touch fetcheth teares; when thou canſt not endure that either the Word of God, or the Rod of God ſhould come too near, or ſo much as touch upon ſuch a carnall contentment, ſuch a comfort, ſuch a Husband, ſuch a Wife or Child, thou canſt not indure that the Lord ſhould ſmite thee in any of theſe: but thou cryeſt out, <hi>Oh ſpare this,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> concerning his <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.4, 5. <hi>Oh tender the young man, pray deal gently with him;</hi> and as old <hi>Jacob</hi> with his <hi>Benjamin, He could more eaſily ſpare his other children than him, he looked with a very tender compaſſionate eye on him.</hi> What ever thou doſt enjoy with ſuch a tender bleeding heart and eye, it hath raviſhed thy heart very far, and it is become thy Idol, and beloved very far, and thy ſin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When the care, anxiety, and ſolicitude of the ſoul runs out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the comforts of this life, ſaying, what ſhall I eat, what ſhall I drink, how ſhall I live and maintain my Wife and Children, what ſhall I do to get, to keep ſuch or ſuch a thing? when the thoughts of the heart are taken up for protection, for proviſion, to get and hold the things of this life; ſuch comforts as are ſo gotten, and ſo enjoyed, they are ſinfully obtained and maintained, and this our
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:46545:270"/> Lord Chriſt doth clear to us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25, 26. And he warns his Diſciples in a ſpeciall manner againſt all ſuch cares, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That comfort which thou art not dead unto, neither is that dead to thee, thou wilt hardly enjoy with ſafety to thy ſelf, or thou wilt part withall but upon ſevere terms.</p>
            <p>If when God by his providence calls for ſuch or ſuch a comfort, Husband, Wife, Child, yet thou canſt not, you will not reſign and give up that comfort at Gods call; but thou groweſt impatient and ſullen, when he doth but attempt to bereave thee of it: God may perhaps let thee have thy luſt, as he dealt with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Pſal. 78.18, 30. but thou ſhalt have that comfort without any comfort, it may be with a curſe.</p>
            <p>When we cannot bear the thoughts of either abſence or loſs of ſuch or ſuch things, cannot endure the thought of parting: it is like the tearing off a limb from the body, when God takes away ſuch a Husband, or Wife, or Child, or Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it argues that they were greatly abuſed while we had them. If there were an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of ſpirit in us, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, &amp;c. That they that were married, were as if they were not married, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they would part upon eaſier terms by far. When the life is bound up in a comfort, it is death to part, <hi>Gen</hi> 44.22.30. as it was with <hi>Jacob</hi> to his <hi>Benjamin.</hi> When the creature hath got too great an intereſt in thee, that thou canſt by no means bring thy heart to think of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, or its leaving thee, though God ſeems to call for it, the heart begins ſecretly to riſe up againſt God, and to murmur and quarrell at providence, this argueth a very carnall heart. If the heart did hang looſe from theſe things, thou mighteſt injoy them with more comfort, and part with them with more eaſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If after God hath been weaning us in a more ſpeciall manner by his Word and Rod, and taking off our hearts from our worldly comforts, yet the ſtrong bent of the ſoul is towards them; it argues much carnall love to them, that we are not crucified to thoſe comforts.</p>
            <p>When the ſoul hath its ſecret ſinfull converſe and fellowſhip with a creature-comfort, againſt its own conviction to the contrary; it may be thou haſt repented, or at leaſt haſt ſeemed to repent of ſuch a way and courſe, yet for all this, thy heart continually hangs that way: and as it is <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.17. Her <hi>ſtoln waters are ſweet, and bread eaten in ſecret is pleaſant,</hi> when a ſtolne glance of the eye, a ſtoln kiſs
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:46545:271"/> from a luſtfull object is ſtill pleaſant to the ſoul, there is much of a meretritious carriage in that heart, it is ſo farre ſinnefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
            <p>When the heart hankers much after ſuch a thing, it is ſtolne away, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4 11. when it hangs after it, as it is <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.17. Their hearts went after their covetouſneſſe: when the heart hath its ſecret haunts and poſtern doores to get out to ſuch or ſuch an object, and that object hath its ſecret paſſage to the ſoul. There be ſome ſecret correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies betwixt the heart and the object, when the luſtfull object hath its wellcome, it no ſooner knocks but it is admitted; when it hath a free paſſage into the heart, and the heart hangs after it, nay, perhaps admits it when it is in duty, if it comes even when we are with God in prayer and is admitted, it argues a ſinfull whoriſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Religion hath its concernment in the credit and reputation which it hath in the world;</hi> Religion hath a name to look after ſo well as you, or I; and it loſeth, or gaineth as it is either honoured, or reproached by the Profeſſors of it: Now when times of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary danger drive us to our Prayers and Vowes to the true God, and we reſolve to have mercy from him, or to chooſe to fall into his hand, this f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ts the credit and honour of Religion, that it can have recourſe to God whom we know can deliver us. This is ſomewhat, but the making a Vow doth not ſo much honour Religion as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of it doth, when it is hereby declared to the world, that Religion is the thing makes men the ſame in their mercies, which they were in their diſtreſſes; that the God they worſhip is the true God, able to require their Vowes if they ſhould neglect to pay them. A Heathen who in diſtreſſe makes a Vow, and in his ſafety performes it carefully, putteth a very high honour upon his falſe God, upon his Idol. What Chriſtian ſoever makes and keeps his Vowes duly, doth likewiſe put an honour on the true God.</p>
            <p>It honours,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The power and providence of God, by acknowleding its Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over all in the world, and its particular diſpoſing and over-ruling of us and our concerns,</hi> when thou Prayeſt and Voweſt in a ſtrait, thou ſeemeſt to tell the world thou believeſt that thy God rules the world by his power and providence.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>It honours God in his readineſſe to hear, and in his faithfullneſſe to anſwer the prayers of his ſuppliants;</hi> Prayers conceived ſpeake a belief that he is ready, Vowes made ſpeak our confidence that he is faithfull, but now Vowes performed ſpeak thus much, that we have found him ſo to us; when <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will pay my vowes,</hi> it is, that he may render to the Lord for the Lords readineſſe and faithfullneſſe to hear and deliver him.

This double bond directly looks to that particular debt, but it works on the debtor's ingenuity and gratitude, to be more carefull in the diſcharge of all his debts, ſo thy Vow looks on a particular, but engageth thee to better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all thy debts to God. Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 56.12, 13. <hi>Thy Vowes are upon me, O God.</hi> Now theſe Vowes were made when he was in danger of his life, as it ſeemeth from the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

Jacob</hi> mentions Tithes as the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular object of his Vow, but <hi>Jacob</hi> withall intended a more exact and circumſpect care over himſelf and Family in matters of Religion, as appeareth by thoſe paſſages, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.2.3. <hi>Jacob ſaid unto his houſhold, and to all that were with him, put away the ſtrange Gods that are among you.</hi> Here is the reforming of his houſhold.

                  <hi>2.</hi> Vowes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover former defects.</note> 
               <hi>Well compoſed Vowes do very much promote Grace and Holineſſe in the heart of the vower, in that it doth bring the man to a ſerious view and ſurvey of his former defects and neglects;</hi> when he comes to look over his ſtreits, what likely brought them on him, and ſo put him on this extraordinary way of ſeeking God, and ſuing for mercy, when he reads over the bond he hath voluntarily entred into, and obſerves what put him thus in debt to God; when he views theſe, and ſuch like particulars, he comes to knowledge of his former aberrations, and defects. Now as a good and carefull tradeſman accounts he is in a good forwardneſſe to a thriving way when he hath found out what did hinder and endammage his trade, for removall of which he hath ſet himſelf in a hopefull and likely way; ſo when a Chriſtian comes
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:46545:287"/> to caſt up accounts, to make even, he finds an unconſtant and ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart hath in this or that particular endammaged him, and if there be any way of dealing with it to keep it conſtant and ſtable, it is by doubling its bonds, and this muſt be done by vow; this courſe is like to repair former defects, and reparation I am ſure is good and effectuall means to keep up the houſe. Some Interpreters tell us, that when <hi>Jacob</hi> came to reform his houſe, it was occaſioned by his defective obſervance of his Vow; and that God in <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.1. puts him in mind of it in ſuch words, <hi>Go up to Beth-el and dwell there, and there build an Altar;</hi> if their conjecture fail not, it is a pertinent inſtance to our caſe; <hi>Jacob</hi> had made a good Vow, and well ordered, and doubtleſſe had performed much of it, yet thirty years after he is minded of it by God, and then he comes to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and performe what was yet wanting, to make up his defects; <hi>Thus when care to perform Vowes well made, diſcovers things ill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the prejudice of Religion, it makes way for future furtherance of Religion.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Sol.</note>To this I anſwer briefly, That <hi>no man in the world may engage himſelf by vow, to live for future without any defects,</hi> ſuch perfection is onely in Heaven; here it is not attainable.

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Well compoſed vowes do promote Religion in the heart and life of a Chriſtian, in that <hi>it ſtrongly and unalterably engageth the Chriſtian against ſome one or other particular, ſinne which would more eaſily prevail, if the reverence or care of ſo ſacred an engagement did not ſet the Chriſtian againſt that ſinne.</hi> Sometime we ſhould ſin by taking too little notice of great providences, or by ſetting them at too low rate, or by ſoon forgetting them, or by waxing proud and inſolent under them. Now ſuch ſins provoke God, weaken Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions intereſſe in the heart, and diminiſh its fruit in the life. Now when vowes prevent ſuch ſinnes, they do as much promote Religion as preventing Phyſick promotes the health of the body; of

Away then with all alluring beauties, I cannot gaze on them, for I cannot be falſe to my vow and covenant. Every Vow is for more ſtrict and exact approbation of our ſelves, in either univerſall, or particular, either in a perpetuall or temporarary obſervance and ſerving the Lord: Now that promotes Religion, which thus exactly and ſtrictly binds the ſoul to approve it ſelf to God: Sinne and Religion have two concernmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now if theſe particulars be conſidered, it cannot ſure be doubted longer, whether well compoſed vowes do promote Religion, when they do ſo engage, and quicken thoſe who vow to ſuch Acts of Duty, to ſuch exerciſe of Grace, to ſuch oppoſition of ſinne, to ſuch improvement of providence, for the increaſe of Grace: And what is Religion but all theſe in one word, and what is the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Religion, but the facilitating, continuing, and perfecting of all theſe, which is not a little furthered by ſuch Vowes.</p>
            <p>It yet remains to ſhew, <hi>Whence theſe well compoſed Vowes have <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Generall. </seg>5</label> ſuch influence on Religion, what have they in them more than ordinary thus to promote it?</hi> To this I will anſwer as briefly as I may; There is in ſuch Vowes a moſt notable awakening, and quickeng power, which ſets all a mans care, wiſedom, truth, and ſtrength on work, to do the things whereby Religion is ſo much promoted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A deep rooted naturall reverence and awe of a ſerious Vow,</hi> which makes the man who hath ſo much ſenſe of Religion as to make a Vow, to have as much care of performing it: Man is readier to caſt off the reverence he owes to Gods Law, than to caſt off the regard he hath to his own Vow, ſo that many times it is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to engage by Vow to do what is our duty by the Law of God: The bond of naturall conſcience is very ſtrong, and Vowes have much of their ſtrength from it, and thereby become great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To this the Christian hath a ſuperadded ſtrict command and preſcript of the Law of God indiſpenſably, requiring the performance of
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:46545:289"/> that Vow which is lawfull and poſſible; I have opened my mouth and I cannot go back,</hi> Judg. 11.35. It is the unalterable Law, if you vow, you muſt pay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.12. God did indulge the Jews ſo farre as to redeem ſome of their vowes, but he allowed none to break them.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Gods ſevere judgments on contemners of their Vowes, adde much to their influence:</hi> I will not mention examples of vengeance on Heathens for breach of their vowes, though the Idol deſerved not better, yet God who is the true God, would have men know ſuch ſacred bonds as Vowes, ſhould not be profaned by ſleight perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or contemned by a totall neglect of them. The Jewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies tell us, that God puniſhed <hi>Jacob</hi> for neglecting his Vow, by <hi>Dinah</hi>'s miſcarriage. However, it is enough God hath threatned the falſifier of his vowes with no leſſe than a deſtruction of the works of his hands, if not with the ruin of his perſon: God will not let ſuch one go unpuniſhed,<note place="margin">Ne ſacrum ejus nomen ludibrio exponeretur ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve populus aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſceret ad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium ejus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptum ſi fraudator im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punè negaret quod Deo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerat, <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus.</hi> loc. com. <hi>45</hi> de Vol.</note>

The great deſign of Satan is, either to detain poor undone creatures in a totall neglect of ſalvation, or to deceive them in the way and means thereof: 'tis therefore the great care of the Apoſtle, as in other Scriptures ſo in this, not only to undeceive the world as to thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes which prevailed then, but to point out the right, the proper, the onely ſure way of ſalvation, <hi>viz.</hi> through Chriſt, whom he here declares to be ſo compleat a Saviour, that as we have <hi>none other,</hi> ſo we need none other, becauſe <hi>Chriſt is all.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In the former part of the verſe, the Apoſtle ſhewes the inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of all things on this ſide Chriſt to commend us unto God, or ſtand us in ſtead in the matter of ſalvation, and this he does by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving four miſtakes (at that time) common.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The miſtake of the Jews, who prided themſelves in a genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall kind of ſanctity, as being the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> this they account ſo great a matter, that they cannot be perſwaded it could go otherwiſe than well with them: let the Meſſengers of God tell them their ſins, warn them of their dangers, yet they ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under this priviledge, as that which would be a ſufficient bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark againſt all kind of threats and comminations: and though

               <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt in his time;<note place="margin">Mat. 3.9. Joh. 8.39, 44.</note> our Saviour is his time; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in theirs, do all concurre in taking them off from leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this broken feed; yet will they not be beaten out of theſe ſtrong holds. Time was indeed when ſalvation was of the Jews; but that wall of partition being now taken down, and the pale of the Church ſo far enlarged, as to take in both Jew and Gentile, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34. no Nationall priviledge can now commend us unto God; nor can a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh avail us, unleſſe we ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in his faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The miſtake of the circumciſed, whether Jews or Proſelytes; who becauſe they had this badge of Religion upon them, concluded themſelves in a priority for Heaven, before all the world beſides. But however time was when Circumciſion was an Ordinance of that neceſſity, that the Lord threatens to puniſh the neglect thereof, by cutting off that ſoul from among his people: yet was it not the outward but ſpirituall part God accounted of. The Apoſtle in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding this, excludes all outward religious Obſervations, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in loc.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Rom. 2.29.</hi> Circumciſio e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat in Judaica Religime ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus praecipuus adhibetur, ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandam obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationem omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um rituum Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galium. <hi>1 Cor. 1.26, 27.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The miſtake of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who were at that time the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of all learning; and all other Nations in contradiſtinction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, were ſtiled Barbarians; and of all Barbarians, the Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were eſteemed the rudeſt. But whatever worth and excellency may be in humane accompliſhments, yet all theſe in the buſineſſe of ſalvation are but poor matters. 'Tis neither the having nor wanting of theſe, that can conſiderably advantage or prejudice us in that high concernment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The common miſtake of the world; who from their rank and quality in the world, are ready to promiſe themſelves a more eaſie acceptance with God.<note place="margin">Act. 10.34. 1 Sam. 16.7.</note> But <hi>God is no respecter of perſons:</hi> He looks upon the children of men with <hi>another kind of eye,</hi> than man is uſed to do. Whether our outward condition be high or mean, there's nothing of priviledge or diſadvantage from hence, in reſpect of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And as in the former clauſe of the Verſe, the Apoſtle ſhews the inſufficiency of all things beſides Chriſt; ſo in this clauſe he ſhews the ſingle ſufficiency of Chriſt alone. Whatever the Jewes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed themſelves from their ſtock and lineage; the Proſelytes from their Circumciſion; the Grecians from their wiſdome and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the great ones of the world from their outward preeminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, all that, yea and much more, is Chriſt to Believers. <hi>Chriſt is all.</hi>

            <pb n="613" facs="tcp:46545:293"/>
            <p>This ſingle ſufficiency of Chriſt the Apoſtle proves by a double Argument.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Wherein Chriſt is All. In general, He is All in All things;
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:46545:294"/> for ſo ſome of no ſmall account render the following words, and <hi>in All,</hi> as hath already been hinted. But more particularly</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt is All to ſincere Chriſtians to free them from whatever might hinder their ſalvation. <hi>Salvation</hi> is not a meer negative thing, nor does it conſiſt in a bare exemption from, hell and wrath, but a tranſlation into heaven and glory; but alas betwixt us and glory, there is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a great Gulph, many bars and impediments; aye but Chriſt is All to deliver us from theſe; and though our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in this world is not compleat or perfect, yet is it ſo for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as to render our ſalvation undoubtfull if we be in the number of them to whole Chriſt is here ſaid to be All.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The wrath of an offended God, which like that flaming ſword that kept our Apoſtate Parents from returning into Paradiſe (out of which becauſe of their Apoſtacy they had been ejected) would render our admiſſion into heaven equally impoſſible; but Chriſt by bearing the wrath of God in his own perſon hath taken it off from ours; and therefore he is ſaid to <hi>deliver us from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.10. he who was the Son of Gods love, became the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his diſpleaſure, as appears by comparing <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. that we who were children of wrath, might become the objects of his favour, and however Chriſt hath not deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers from the anger of God as a Father, yet from the anger of God as a Judge. There is an anger that proceeds from love, as the anger of a Parent towards that childe whoſe good he deſires; and there is a vindictive anger:<note place="margin">Heb. 12.6, 7, 8, &amp;c.</note> the former beleevers are neither freed from, nor would it indeed be their priviledge; there is not a greater judgement can befall poor ſinfull creatures here on earth, than for God not to diſcover himſelf angry with them for their ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. God then deals with men as a skiliull Phyſitian with an unruly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient whom he gives up as deſperate,<note place="margin">Magna ira eſt quando peccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus non i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> or as a tender Parent with a graceleſs childe, whom he utterly rejects. In a word, what ever kinde of anger might tend to the prejudice of beleevers, that they are delivered from, but what is for their advantage that they are ſubject to. That Chriſt is All in delivering from the wrath of God may further be evidenced by theſe Conſiderations:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The adequate of Gods wrath is ſin; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> there is this difference 'twixt wrath and mercy in God; that mercy flows (as I may ſo ſpeak) naturally from God, and hath no other motive but onely the gracious and mercifull diſpoſition of God; but wrath hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes its riſe from us, and nothing in us but ſin can draw down his
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:46545:295"/> wrath upon us. Our meaneſs cannot, our afflictions cannot; theſe may ſometimes be the effects of Gods wrath, but never the cauſes. No 'tis <hi>becauſe of theſe things the wrath of God cometh upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 5 6. <hi>becauſe of theſe things, ie.</hi> becauſe of theſe ſins as appears from the Verſes foregoing, What is it that hath filled every age and place of the world with ſo many dreadfull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods diſpleaſure, but onely ſin? What was it that caſt the Angels out of heaven, and degraded them from their firſt ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onely ſin? What was it that drove our firſt Parents out of Paradiſe, and ſubjected them, and all their Poſterity to ſo many miſeries, but onely ſin? What was it that brought deſtruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the old World, upon <hi>Sodome, Gemorrah, Admah, Zeboim?</hi> What was it that broke off the natural branches, and hath for ſo many hundreds of years continued them under a divorce from God, but onely ſin? In a word, look over all thoſe miſeries under which the whole Creation groans, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 22. And though thoſe miſeries in ſeveral creatures are divers, yet do they all proceed from the ſame fountain, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt is All in making expiation for ſin. He is that <hi>Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> Joh. 1.29. He is our <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 2.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. 'twas not <hi>thouſands of Rams,</hi> not <hi>ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl,</hi> could have born any proportion in point of ſatisfaction for our ſins. 'Twas not all the Legal Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of old could do any thing, nor can all our duties now; but Chriſt is all in expiating for ſin, <hi>Heb</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. And ſuch is the fulneſs of Chriſts ſatisfaction, that he hath not onely freed ſuch as are united unto him from <hi>condemnation,</hi> Rom. 8.1. but purchaſed for them the Adoption of children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14, 15, 16. And thus Chriſt is All in removing this bar, and opening this door to ſalvation which (had it not been for his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation) would for ever have remained ſhut againſt all the children of men. The pollution and prevalency of corruption, how great an impediment this is to ſalvation, and happineſs, was typified by the Lepers and unclean perſons of old who were not admitted within the <hi>Camp.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 13.46.</note> Heaven is no common receptacle for all perſons, as <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark was for all ſorts of creatures, <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. Know ye not? if you know any thing in Religion you cannot but know thus much. In the Church of God on earth there is a mixture of <hi>Corn</hi> with <hi>Chaffe,</hi> of <hi>Wheat</hi> with <hi>Tares,</hi> of good Fiſh with bad, of

Do but conſider and pauſe a while upon that miſchief which ſin hath done poor creatures by its pollution. How hath it ſtained their glory? caſt them down from their excellency? turned Angels into Devils, and debaſed man who was once almoſt the top of the whole Creation, in whom all the ſcattered Excellencies in the Book of Nature were bound up together in one Volume, and met together in a bleſſed union. How unlike hath ſin made us to what God at firſt made us? Thoſe ſouls of ours which were once as ſo many pure beams of Light, how is the beauty of them now blotted and darkned? But Chriſt is that <hi>Fountain opened for ſin &amp; uncleanneſs,</hi> Zech. 13.1. in his blood is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue enough to fetch out <hi>ſcarlet</hi> ſpots, and <hi>crimſon</hi> ſtains, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18 and if any of the children of men periſh in their pollutions, 'tis not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wants ſufficiency, but becauſe they want faith. Chriſt is All in the buſineſs of cleanſing and purifying. But alas,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note> beſides the pollution of ſin, there is the prevalency of it. This was to St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo great an affliction, that he who could bear the greateſt of outward afflictions patiently, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24, 25, &amp;c. cannot but expreſs ſomething of an holy impatience under this burden, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. he that could triumph over <hi>Principalities, Powers, Life, Death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 38, 39. is yet more than a little diſcouraged when he reflects upon the corruptions he found lodging in his own heart. Corruption is the great Tyrant that hath uſurped over the whole world, the bounds of its Dominion are almoſt as large as all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, there is not a man in all the world (except the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> made after Gods Image, and the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> who was God as well as man, but he is born a ſlave, a vaſſal to this Uſurper. The four great ſucceſſive Monarchies, <hi>Chaldean, Perſian, Graecian, Roman,</hi> though the extent of them were great and the circumference vaſt, yet were all theſe limited and bounded, ſome parts of the world there were which knew nothing of their yoke. But alas the Empire of Corruption reaches every corner of the earth, every perſon born into the world. We may therefore not unfitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Tree, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4 11. the top whereof reaches Heaven, from thence it threw the Angels, and the boughs thereof ſpreading themſelves to the ends of the earth; yea this vaſſallage unto Corruption, as it is the largeſt and univerſaleſt, ſo alſo the miſerableſt, and moſt dreadfull. All other ſlaveries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:46545:296"/> with this, are but like <hi>Rehoboams</hi> Government compared to his Father <hi>Solomons,</hi> the <hi>leaſt finger,</hi> of whoſe Dominion he threatens ſhould be <hi>heavier than his Fathers loyns,</hi> 1 King. 12.10. We read in Scripture of an <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſlavery; in Hiſtory of the <hi>Spartan</hi> ſlavery, and of the <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> all theſe ſad and lamentable; but yet all theſe reached but the body, and that for a time onely, whereas the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Corruption reaches the ſoul, and that for ever, unleſs Chriſt become our Jeſus in ſaving us from our ſins, <hi>Matth</hi> 1.21. He hath purchaſed our freedome, and that with a great ſumme, as the Centurion ſpeaks of his <hi>Roman</hi> freedome, <hi>Act</hi> 22 26, 27, 28. There are none can ſay with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they are born free, except they who are born again, and they are free indeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.36. Chriſt is All in removing this impediment alſo, in ſetting our poor captive ſouls at liberty, from the bonds and fetters of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8, &amp;c. <hi>Rom</hi> 7.25. 'Tis he alone can conquer theſe great <hi>Goliahs,</hi> theſe untamed affections; but yet even this deliverance is alſo incompleat in this world, he delivers his people from corruption as to the reign and dominion of it, though not as to the preſence and diſturbance of it, <hi>ut non regnet ſed nondum ut non ſit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The oppoſitions of Satan, his wiles and ſubtilties, theſe are another impediment, and that no ſmall one neither; for if our firſt parents in whom there was nothing of ignorance, but a ſufficiency of knowledge, there was indeed a neſcience of many things, ſo is there alſo in the Angels, <hi>Matth</hi> 24 36. but yet their knowledge was both full and clear in things neceſſary and pertinent, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. This was no ſmall advantage againſt the methods of Satan, becauſe his uſual way of miſchieving poor creatures hath not been ſo much by force as fraud, not as a Lion, but as a Serpent, not ſo much by conquering, as cheating; acting all his enmity under a pretence of friendſhip, and tempting us to no evil, but under the pretence of ſome good. The advantage of our firſt Parents was in this reſpect great in reſpect of their knowledge. Beſides in them was nothing of weakneſs, but a ſufficiency of ſtrength, in them was nothing of corruption, but an univerſal rectitude and uprightneſs. The wayes by which Satan ordinarily prevails, is either by our ignorance, or by our weakneſs, or elſe by making a party within us againſt our ſelves. The advantages of our firſt Parents were in all theſe reſpects far greater than any have againſt Satan now, yet Satan prevailed againſt them. What cauſe therefore have we to fear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3.
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:46545:296"/> But <hi>Chriſt is all</hi> to free us from theſe dangers, to carry us through theſe oppoſitions, who <hi>hath led captivity captive,</hi> Epheſ. 4.8. <hi>who hath ſpoiled Principalities and powers, and triumphed over them,</hi> Col. 2.15. but yet even this deliverance is at preſent incompleat; for though Chriſt hath delivered believers from Satan as a <hi>deſtroyer,</hi> yet not from Satan as a <hi>tempter,</hi> he may diſquiet ſuch but he cannot ruin them.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt is All,</hi> to fill the ſouls of believers with all that good which may capacitate and qualifie them for happineſſe: it is the decree of Heaven, that none be admitted into glory, but thoſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What is the reaſon of that diverſity of delights which is among the children of men, that which is one mans joy is another mans grief, and that which is one mans pleaſure is another mans pain? the onely reaſon is, becauſe of the diverſity of tempers and diſpoſitions: Some there be of ſuch a bruitiſh and ſwiniſh tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that nothing is ſo pleaſing unto them as wallowing in the mire of their ſenſualities: others again of ſo refined a temper, that they eſteem theſe ſenſuall pleaſures very low and much beneath them, but ſtill every mans delight is according to his temper and diſpoſition,
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:46545:297"/> and therefore Heaven would be ſo farre from being a Heaven unto ſuch, that it would be a kind of hell to them; for as delight ariſes from an harmony betwixt the perſon and the object, ſo all kind of torment from an unſuitableneſſe and contrariety: hence is it, that although God vouchſafes us ſomething of Heaven here on earth, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Ordinances, yet to unheavenly hearts every thing of this nature is a <hi>taedium</hi> a burden: <hi>When will the new Moon be gone that we may ſell Corn? and the Sabbath that we may ſet forth wheat,</hi> &amp;c.

So may we ſay of carnall perſons, had they the hearts and diſpoſitions of believers, they would be as much delighted with all means of communion with God as they are, and account that their priviledge which now they eſteem their vexation: the Greeks tell us, that <gap reason="foreign">

               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.12.</note> Others to whom All that is in Chriſt is ſo far from being to their ſalvation, that it only aggravates
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:46545:300"/> their deſtruction. He that is to ſome <hi>the chief corner ſtone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.6, 8.</note> is to others no better than a <hi>ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence.</hi> This was propheſied of Chriſt, This childe ſhall be <hi>for the fall and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing again of many in Iſrael.</hi> There's no mercy ſo eminently good,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.34.</note> but through our corruptions it may become an occaſion of evil. Chriſt himſelf, the greateſt of mercies that ever God vouchſafed to creatures, is yet ſo far from ſaving ſome from their ſins, that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſes their ſin.<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.22.</note> 
               <hi>If I had not come and ſpoke unto them they had not had ſin, but now they have no cloak for their ſin.</hi> Thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the Miniſtry of Chriſt in his own perſon, and were not wrought upon thereby, all their ſins would comparatively have been a kind of innocence, had they not diſcovered ſuch an height of obſtinacy: 'tis therefore no common priviledge. But what ſhould we do that it may be ours? Take theſe few Directions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Labour to get your judgements ſetled in the belief of this great truth: That all things in the world are a very nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt: That you are poor in the midſt of worldly riches, and miſerable in the midſt of all earthly happineſſe, while you remain in your eſtrangements from Chriſt: And that of all kind of poverty and miſery this is the worſt, becauſe it is in thoſe ſpirituall bleſſings wherein conſiſts both our preſent and future happineſſe. 'Tis but little thoſe perſons underſtand of their great concernments, that can with that Goſpel-fool, think themſelves ſufficiently provided for in the things of this world, and ſay to their ſouls as he to his, <hi>Soul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12.19.</note> 
               <hi>thou haſt goods laid up for many years, eat, drinke, and be merry.</hi> Doſt thou know thou liveſt in this world upon the very brink of eternity? And doſt thou know whether there be more than <hi>one ſtep between</hi> thee and another world?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 20.2.</note> And canſt thou take up with any thing on this ſide Chriſt? it is an argument you know but little of your own concernments. Some of the groſſer <hi>Platoniſts</hi> thought the world to be a great. <hi>Animal,</hi> and the ſoul which acted it was God; now if the ſoul be departed from the body, what is it but a meer carkaſſe without life. Chriſt is the very life and ſoul of all our comforts, and without him all our creature-enjoyments are but as ſo many cyphers without a figure, which have no ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in them, but are as ſo many nothings. Nothing in reſpect of true comfort here; nothing in reſpect of your preparations for another world. Labour therefore through the glaſſe both of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and experience, to behold all the excellencies of this world as ſo many bladders filled with wind, and at beſt to be like <hi>Hagars</hi>
               <pb n="628" facs="tcp:46545:301"/> Bottle which was ſoon empty,<note place="margin">Gen. 21.15.</note> or as <hi>broken Ciſterns, Ciſterns,</hi> and therefore cannot hold much, <hi>broken Ciſterns,</hi> and therefore cannot hold what they have long.<note place="margin">Ier. 2.13.</note> And withall let it be your wiſdome to look upon Chriſt as that everlaſting Fountain of all good which can never be drawn dry, as that never failing Spring of all thoſe bleſſings which will not onely ſweeten every condition here, but go with us beyond death, and the grave. Such fixed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of theſe things will be ſingularly uſefull to engage our ſouls in an earneſt purſuit after Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.8.</note> or in the Pſalmiſts words, <hi>to follow hard after him,</hi> and 'tis his promiſe, that they <hi>that come to him he will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> Joh. 6.37.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be ſpeedy in caſting out thoſe inmates, which becauſe they are unmeet companions for Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 5.4. Amos 3.3.</note> may hinder his taking poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your ſouls. The <hi>Ark</hi> and <hi>Dagon</hi> could not ſtand together in the ſame room, but if the <hi>Ark</hi> ſtands, <hi>Dagon</hi> falls. Can two walk together except they be agreed. Chriſt and our corruptions are at no agreement, theſe two cannot dwell together under the ſame roof. If you would have Chriſt to take up his abode in your hearts, you muſt prepare a place for him;<note place="margin">Pſal. 132.4, 5.</note> It was ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> he would neither give <hi>ſleep to his eyes, nor ſlumber to his eye-lids,</hi> till he had found out an habitation for the mighty God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> The ſouls of moſt men are ſo crowded with other gueſts, that the beſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they can afford Chriſt, is but ſuch as he found in his firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the world, an out-room, a ſtable, a manger: But let it be your care to renounce communion with all things that might hinder your communion with him,<note place="margin">Pſal, 45.10, 11.</note> to <hi>forget thy own people, and thy Fathers houſe, ſo ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty;</hi> ſo, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, he will have no rivals, no competitors, not a part of our heart, but all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be willing to accept of Chriſt upon his own termes, there can be no termes hard on which we may gain an intereſt in him.<note place="margin">Matth. 16.24.</note> The great and main condition is Self-denial together with a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of our ſelves to him, and ſelf-denial, if duely conſidered, is the greateſt ſelf-advantage. 1. Becauſe he calls us not to deny our ſelves in any thing that is truly for our ſpiritual good, or at leaſt ſo far as 'tis for our good. 2. Though he calls us to deny our ſelves in many outward good things, yet 'tis not ſo much to part with them as to exchange them for what is better. 3. The main objects of ſelf-denial are thoſe things which 'tis our priviledge to be freed from; no reaſon therefore to be offended at ſuch termes as theſe, to reſign
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:46545:301"/> up our miſtaken judgements to the guidance of infinite Wiſdome, our corrupt wills to his moſt holy and gracious will,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.3. Pſal. 119.151, 172.</note> to be in all things at the command of him, whoſe commands are in nothing <hi>grievous,</hi> but in all things <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> Be therefore as willing to be his, as you are deſirous he ſhould be yours; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent muſt be mutual, or elſe the match can never be made up 'twixt Chriſt, and your ſouls,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Meaſure all things by their reference unto Chriſt, of all good things account them the beſt which may promote your endeavours after that good which is the higheſt; as Ordinances,<note place="margin">Pſal. 27.4. Pſal. 42.1, 2. Pſal. 63.1, 2. Iſa. 59.2.</note> the means of Grace, which at how high a rate they are valued by <hi>David,</hi> may appear from his pathetical, and moſt affectionate deſires of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God in them; of all evill things account them the worſt which eſtrange you from Chriſt the trueſt good, and therefore let your only impatience be of ſin, as that which onely <hi>ſeparates between you and your God.</hi> The obſervation of this rule will very much ſecure you from all diverſions, and quicken you in your endeavours after an intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Be ſerious in reſolving this great Queſtion, whether Chriſt who is All to ſincere Chriſtians be All to you; 'tis a queſtion of that importance, that all your comfort depends upon the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, yea all your hopes. Take theſe two Characters.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Are you conformable unto Chriſt? Is the ſame <hi>minde in you</hi> that <hi>was in him?</hi> Are you holy and humble, and ſelf-denying, and in all things followers of that pattern which he hath ſet before you in his own example? <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>Old things are paſſed away, behold all things are bicome new,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 2.5. Rom. 8.9.</note> 2 Cor. 5.17. Cauſes are beſt known by their effects, Trees by their fruits, Fountains by their ſtreams. So is our intereſt in Chriſt by this effect thereof, our conformity unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are you All to him: 'Tis but a juſt retaliation in Chriſtians to be ſo, and 'tis withall an evidence that Chriſt is All to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Are you all to him in your <hi>affections,</hi> in prizing him above all, can you with the Spouſe eſteem the love of Chriſt <hi>better than wine,</hi> with <hi>David better than life,</hi> can you in the middeſt of all your crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts, account all as nothing in compariſon of him, and ſay with <hi>Aſaph, Whom have I in heaven but God, and there is none on earth I deſire in compariſon of him.</hi> So high were <hi>Moſes</hi> affections,<note place="margin">Cant. 1.2. Pſal. 63.3. Pſal. 73.25. Heb. 11.26.</note> that he eſteems <hi>the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt.</hi> And indeed if Chriſt be but an underling in our affections,
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:46545:302"/>
'tis an argument we have no part in him. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me is not worthy of me;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 10.37.</note> 
               <hi>he that loveth ſon or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> The affections are the trueſt pulſe of the ſoul, the moſt genuine and natural ſymptomes of its frame and temper. 'Tis theſe that ſpeak the proper idiom and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the heart. Make uſe of this rule therefore, is Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt in thy heart, thy affection to him is an evidence of his to thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are you all to him in your <hi>acknowledgements</hi> in aſcribing all to him. Thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>By the Grace of God I am what I am.</hi> That my condition is not better it is from my ſelf, that 'tis ſo good 'tis from him, ſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 5, 20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Are you all to him in your <hi>contentment</hi> and ſatisfaction, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting you have all in him though you have nothing beſides him, <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither fruits be in the Vine, the labour of the Olive ſhall fail,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hab. 3.17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c. yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Are you all to him in your <hi>dependances</hi> and expectations in ſeeking all from him, the higheſt condition of grace, needs further grace, but in Chriſt are all ſupplies; 'tis an argument of our intereſt in him when in all diſtreſſes we make him our refuge, in all weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes our ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Are you all to him in your deſigns and aims, in ſeeking his glory beyond your private advantages; this was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> deſign in life and death that <hi>Chriſt</hi> might <hi>be magnified,</hi> Philip. 1.20. and if you be thus all to Chriſt, 'tis an evidence Chriſt is All to you. And how well are they provided for, who have him who is All for their Portion.</p>

            <p>In handling of this Point I ſhall firſt lay before you the grounds of it, and then adjoyn ſuch practical application, as may be uſefull and profitable.</p>
            <p>The grounds of this Truth do partly refer to God, partly to wicked men, and partly to the godly themſelves; if in ſuch a condition a beleeving ſoul either look upwards, or outwards, or inwards, he will ſee much cauſe of grief and trouble.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With reference unto God, and that upon a double account:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a real ground of ſorrow to a beleeving ſoul to be deprived of occaſions of ſolemn bleſſing and prayſing God; the ſoul that is full of the ſenſe of the goodneſs of God, that knows how many thouſand wayes the Lord is continually obliging it to love and bleſs him, cannot but be afflicted in ſpirit, to be kept from making its publick acknowledgements of divine goodneſs. The Pſalmiſt tell us, <hi>Pſal</hi> 65 1. <hi>that Praiſe waiteth for God in Sion,</hi> that is, in the publick Aſſemblies of the Church; and truly 'tis a grief to a believing ſoul, not to wait there with his thank-offerings, not to pay his <hi>vows unto the Lord in the preſence of all his people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 116.17. Pſal. 66.18.</note> 
               <hi>in the Courts of the Lords houſe, &amp;c.</hi> not to declare to all that fear God what he hath done for their ſouls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a real ground of ſorrow to live among thoſe that are continually reproaching and blaſpeming the Name of God: to ſee
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:46545:304"/> ſinners deſpiſe the goodneſs of God, and trample upon his grace and mercy, and ſcorn his love and kindneſs, and kick at his bowels, and ſpit in his face, and ſtab at his heart, who is our God, our Father, our Friend, our good and gracious Lord and King: This muſt needs make the beleeving ſoul cry out, Woe is me that I live among ſuch.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe a perſon that hath been hugely obliged by a Prince to love him, and that indeed loves him as his life, if this Prince ſhould be driven from his Throne, and an uſurper get into his place, would it not be great affliction, and ſadning to the ſpirit of ſuch a perſon, to live among thoſe who every day revile, reproach, ſcorn and abuſe his gracious Prince? Why Sirs, if you and I be true beleevers, we know that the Lord is our Soveraign King &amp; Prince, ſuch a one who hath infinitely more obliged us to love him, than 'tis poſſible for any Prince to oblige a ſubject; &amp; we do love the Lord as our lives, nay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than our lives, or elſe we love him not at all; &amp; muſt it not then be matter of grief, to hear ungodly ſinners, who have driven God away from their hearts &amp; ſouls, where his Throne ſhould be ſet up, and who have let that grand uſurper the Devil ſet up his throne within them, and among them, and who daily ſay unto God, as thoſe wicked ones, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes,</hi> to hear ſuch curſe and ſwear and blaſpheme God, and in their lives by wicked ungodly courſes do him all the deſpight &amp; diſhonor that they can, bring his Name to the Tavern, to the Stews, upon the ſtage, and there foot and defile the great and glorious Name of God with the worſt of polutions; Certainly Sirs, he cannot account God his Friend, his Father, his good and gracious Prince, whoſe eye doth not run down with Rivers of tears to ſee men ſo far from keeping Gods Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a trouble to good men to ſojourn, &amp;c. with reference to thoſe wicked ungodly perſons among whom they live, it grieves their ſouls to ſee ſinners <hi>run into all exceſs of riot,</hi> eagerly purſuing hell and damnation, greedily guzling down full draughts of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of Aſps, and the poyſon of Dragons; it pities them to ſee ſinners ſtab themſelves to the heart, and laughing at their own plague ſores, jeaſting away God, and heaven, and eternal happineſs. If any of us ſhould ſee a company of men ſo far beſotted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, as that one ſhould rend and burn the Evidences of a great Inheritance which others labour to deprive him of, another ſhould caſt ineſtimable pearls and jewels into the Sea, another eagerly
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:46545:304"/> drinking down that which you knew to be the juice of Toads and Spiders, or hugging a Viper, and Scorpion in his boſome, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the ſtabbing himſelf in the breaſt, another laughing at, and licking his own plague ſores, and all of them reviling, curſing, ſtriking, ſpitting in the face, and ſtabbing at the heart of thoſe that any wayes endeavour to hinder them from deſtroying themſelves, or that will not do as they do, and be as mad as themſelves, ſhould we not pity them, and with grief of heart ſay, <hi>Wo is me that I live among ſuch?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why Sirs, He that hath had any ſerious thoughts of Eternity, that hath ſoberly conſidered the worth of an immortal ſoul, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Holineſs, Juſtice, and Power of God, that underſtands the evill of ſin, what a plague, what a venome, what a dagger at the ſinners own heart, ſin is, he cannot but ſee and know that every ungodly prophane ſinner is much more an object of higheſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion than any I have now mentioned, and therefore cannot but cry out, <hi>Wo is me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a trouble to good men to ſojourn, &amp;c. with reference to themſelves, and their own concernments, becauſe they are ſenſible that ſuch a condition layes them open to a great deal of danger; and that</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of their graces; for the want of the ſociety of good men, and the Ordinances of the Goſpel, is like the want of dew and rain to the graſs, or food to the body; and therefore thoſe who have taſted of <hi>the ſweetneſs and fatneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 36.8.65.4.</note> and know what a bleſſedneſs 'tis to be <hi>ſatisfied with the goodneſs</hi> of Gods houſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but mourn over the want of Goſpel-Ordinances; as the preſence of the Sun beams make the flowers to be freſh and beautifull, and yield a fragrant ſmell; whereas the want thereof makes them look pale and wan, and hang the head; even ſo the enjoyment of good ſociety and Goſpel-Ordinances, makes the graces of a beleever amiable and lovely, and give forth their pleaſant ſmell, the want of which makes them very much to droop and languiſh.</p>
            <p>And then on the other ſide, the ſociety of wicked men, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome and poyſon of an evill example, the alluring flatteries of the world on one hand, and its frowns and threatnings on the other hand, are of great force to nip and blaſt, to dead and dull the graces of good men.</p>
            <p>And therefore he who knows the worth and value of true grace, that accounts it his riches, his treaſure, his jewel, his life,<note place="margin">Luke 12.21.</note> and is ſenſible how much depends upon the life and vigour of Grace and
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:46545:305"/> Religion in his ſoul, and underſtands how deſtructive the want of Goſpe-Ordinances, and the company of evil men are to his graces, may well cry out, <hi>Wo is me that I ſojourn,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard of their perſons, and the concernments of this life; the enmity that is in the ſeed of the Serpent, againſt the ſeed of the Woman, doth not onely put forth it ſelf in endeavours to ruine or weaken their graces, but alſo to deſtroy their perſons: wicked mens malice againſt that ſpiritual life of grace in good men, which themſelves do not partake of, doth ſoon improve into malice alſo againſt that natural humane life which themſelves are alſo partakers of; their deſires to ſuck the blood, as I may ſo ſay, of good mens ſouls &amp; graces makes them delight to ſuck the blood of their bodies; witneſs <hi>Cain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.12.</note> the firſt that learnt this bloody trade, by killing his brother for no other cauſe, but <hi>becauſe his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous;</hi> witneſs alſo <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel, Manaſſeh,</hi> &amp;c. but the foul-mouthed, witneſs to this black and ſad rruth, is the ſcarlet bloody Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi>

            <p>And now the wofull condition of thoſe that are deprived of Goſpel Ordinances, and ſojourn where heavenly M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="637" facs="tcp:46545:305"/> but being abroad, are not onely deprived of them, but liable to the Inquiſition, and other wayes of perſecution for their Religion?</p>
            <p>Before I anſwer the Caſe I ſhall a little open it, and lay down ſome preparatory propoſitions for the right underſtanding of it, and then direct our practiſe.</p>
            <p>By Religion we do not underſtand any outward way or form, any pomp and gayeties in worſhipping God; but ſuch a due ſenſe of our dependance upon a good and gracious, almighty holy God, for our being and well-being both in time and to eternity, as doth powerfully engage the ſoul heartily to love God, and ſincerely to ſerve him, in obeying his good and holy commands made known to us.</p>
            <p>By the life of Religion we may underſtand, either 1. The truth and reality of it in the ſoul, in oppoſition to a ſoul dead in ſin; or 2. The vigour, activity and livelineſſe of Religion, in oppoſition to a dead, dull languid principle; and both may be well included in the Queſtion, for as we are all concerned to endeavour, by all fit and lawfull means, not only to have our bodies kept from rotting and putrifying by the <hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>a living ſoul,</hi> but to have them active and vigorous, ſit for the employments of a naturall life,<note place="margin">Salillum ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae. <hi>Plaut.</hi>
               </note> and not ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with lethargies and benumming palſies; even ſo we ought to endeavour, not only that our ſouls may be quickned with a true principle of Religion, but that we may have ſuch a lively, vigorous and influencing ſence of divine goodneſſe upon them, that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may not be a dull, languid, lethargick principle, but may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us fit and prompt for all the actions of a ſpirituall life. And now, this life of Religion, the caſe ſuppoſeth the perſon to have, who needs advice; and then you'l quickly perceive that there be two things in danger,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The life of Religion in a religious perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The life of a religious perſon; and ſo the caſe doth reſolve it ſelf into theſe two Queries,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What ſhould believing Chriſtians do to ſupport the life and vigour of Religion in their ſouls when they want the ordinary means of publick Ordinances, and are indangered by the leavening ſociety of wicked men?</p>
            <p n="2">2. How ſhould they preſerve their lives among perſecuting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without hazarding the life of their Religion?</p>
            <p>For the clearing of and directing in this caſe I ſhall now premiſe ſome Propoſitions fit to be taken notice of,</p>
            <pb n="638" facs="tcp:46545:306"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1.</note>It cannot be expected, that any Rule ſhould be given, according to Scripture, whereby both the one, and the other life may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſecured; for many times Gods providence brings us into ſuch circumſtances, that if we are reſolved, that come what will, wee'l keep our Religion, we muſt loſe our lives: and if we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to keep our lives, though with the hazard, or ſhipwrack of our Religion, we muſt then part with our Religion, and perhaps our lives too.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There can be no certain and infallible courſe propounded whereby the life of the body may be ſecured with the loſſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; though Devil and world bid fair, and promiſe we ſhall live and do well if we will part with our Religion, yet they are not able, if willing to make good their promiſe, ſo long as there be ſo many thouſand wayes to death beſides Martyrdome; and this is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that threatning expreſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it,</hi> not only that eternall life which is the only true life, but even this temporall life; as many relations tell us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The life of Religion in the ſoul, is that which by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and our ſpirituall care and induſtry may be infallibly ſecured in any place, among any perſons, in any condition; I do not ſay the outward exerciſe of Religion, but that which is the life and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Religion in the ſoul may be preſerved. Force and violence may deprive thoſe that are religious, of opportunities to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and pour forth their <hi>Common prayers</hi> and ſupplications to God, and publikely ſing forth the praiſes of God, and hear the great truths of the Goſpell preached unto them; nay they may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from ſpeaking with their mouthes, either to God, or for God; as many of the Martyrs have been gagged: but all the force and violence in the world, cannot take away that which is the principle and life of Religion (unleſſe we our ſelves betray and caſt it from us) nor can they hinder the prime, and principall acts and exerciſes of Religion. All the world cannot hinder you or me, from having good thoughts of God, from ſanctifying the Lord God in our hearts, from truſting in, hoping in, rejoycing in, the goodneſſe and mercy of God through Jeſus Chriſt; from making holy melody in our hearts, and ſuch muſick as ſhall be heard beyond the ſphears, though he that ſtands at our elbow knows not a word we ſpeak; ſo that true Religion both in the principle and prime exerciſes of it may be infallibly ſecured, inſomuch that he who can rend the heart out of the body, cannot tear Religion out of the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="639" facs="tcp:46545:306"/>4. His ſoul cannot be quickned with the life of the Religion of the Goſpell, who is not in heart perſwaded, that the ſecuring the life of Religion in his ſoul, is hugely more his concernment, than the preſerving of the life of the body. Yea his Religion is built on a ſandy foundation, who hath not ſeriouſly conſidered, that for ought he knows, his Religion may coſt him his life, and hath not brought his ſoul to an humble reſolution to lay down his life, rather than let go his Religion: thus much is clearly imported in that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.27, 28, &amp;c. <hi>Which of you intending to build a tower, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not down firſt and counteth the coſt,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſociety of good men, and enjoyment of Goſpell Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is of ſpeciall uſe to preſerve, quicken and enliven the principle of Religion in the ſoul; they are to Religion in the ſoul, what food is to the naturall life of the body: and therefore the Ordinances in the Church, are compared to <hi>breaſts of conſolation,</hi> Iſa. 66.11. The great deſign of God in appointing Goſpell-Ordinances is, that by the help and aſſiſtance of thoſe gifts and graces which he beſtows upon his Miniſters, the ſouls of thoſe who are eſtranged from him, ſhould be brought home to the owning and acknowledging of the truth; and that thoſe who have returned to the Lord, ſhould be more and more affected with a ſenſe of divine goodneſſe, and their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Lord, for all they have and hope for; and indeed if preaching, and reading, and praying, and every other Ordinance, both in publike and in private, do not aim at and intend this great end, the begetting or actuating and ſtirring up the life of Religion in our ſouls, then are they, what ſome would fain perſwade us, vain, uſeleſſe, troubleſome things. If thy coming to Church to hear a prayer, or a Sermon, be not by thee deſigned, and do not in the even tend to make thee better, to love God more, loath ſin more, and value the world leſſe, and reſolve more heartily to obey the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, thou hadſt as good have been in thy bed or ſhop as in the Church; and if in preaching and praying, we that are Gods mouth to you, and your mouth to God, have any other deſign than to ſtir up in your ſouls good thoughts of God, affectionate workings of heart towards a loving tender-hearted father, zealous and hungring deſires, to do the will of God, and expreſſe our love by obeying his commandments, I ſeriouſly profeſſe I ſhould think my ſelf much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imployed to be working in a Coblers ſtall, or raking in the ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, or filling a dung cart, than preaching or praying in a pulpit; and let thoſe who do not intend theſe great ends, know, that ere long
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:46545:307"/> they will finde, they had bettter have been imployed in the moſt debaſing drudgery, than in the outward work of God with ſiniſter and unworthy ends.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, the caſe reſolves it ſelf into theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar queſtions,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What ſhould beleeving Chriſtians do to ſupport the life of Religion in their ſouls, when they want the ordinary food of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Goſpel-Ordinances?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What ſhould ſuch do to preſerve their outward concernments among perſecuting enemies without hazarding their Religion?</p>
            <p>In anſwer to the firſt queſtion take theſe Directions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let ſuch humbly reflect upon their former ſleighting, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and abuſing the means of grace which now they want; it is the uſual method of God, to teach us the worth of mercies either temporal or ſpiritual by the want of them, and to bring us to want thoſe mercies which we abuſe; if the childe play with, or throw about his meat, he may well think a wiſe and loving Father will make him feel the want of it, and thereby know the worth of it; and certainly we have as much reaſon to fear the fulfilling of thoſe threatnings which the Miniſters of the Goſpel have for many years ſounded in our ears, for our abuſe of the means of grace; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if Gods providence ſhould call the moſt of us into <hi>Spain,</hi> or ſome other Popiſh Country where we ſhould have <hi>a famine of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of the Lord,</hi> might we not ſadly reflect upon our deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, yea and loathing the heavenly Manna of Gods Word? I ſpeak not of the prophane ungodly wretches, who ſcarce ever had any ſerious thoughts of Eternity, nor ever ſoberly conſidered whether they were at all beholden unto God or no, that never knew how to value a Bible above a Play-book, or the Sacrament above a drunken meeting whoſe Religion is to ſcoffe and mock at godlineſs and godly men, and who ſcarce ever knew any other end in coming to Church, but to mock or carp at the Preacher, who may with trembling read their doom, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. But I ſpeak of the Profeſſors of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, how have they either by reaſon of new fangled opinions, ſleighted and deſpiſed Goſpel-Ordinances? or elſe by reaſon of fulneſs of ſpiritual food, have loathed and trampled upon the means of grace, to whom the Lord ſeems to ſpeak, as to thoſe <hi>Ezek</hi> 34 18, 19. <hi>Seemeth it a ſmall thing unto you to have eaten up the good paſture but you muſt tread down with your feet the reſidue of your paſtures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye muſt foul the reſidue with
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:46545:307"/> your feet? And as for my flock they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet;</hi> or elſe having enjoyed them, and made uſe of them, have been little the better by them? have not lived and practiſed the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons they have heard, and the prayers they have made? Oh let ſuch be ſure in the firſt place to give glory to God, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them of ſuch means, by acknowledging his juſtice in taking away what hath been ſo much abuſed, or at beſt ſo little improved; then let them with broken and bleeding hearts reflect upon thoſe full Banquets of ſpiritual dainties, the fragments of which in a time of want they would be glad of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Heartily reſolve, if ever the Lord bring you again to enjoy Goſpel-Ordinances, you will more value, prize, and improve them; and indeed that alone which can make our repentings and ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon former miſcarriages not to be mockings of God, and couſening our ſelves, muſt be an hearty reſolution againſt what we profeſs to be ſorry for; and therefore that our reſolution in ſuch a caſe may be the more fixed, it would be good to record it in our Note-books, that ſo it may be a continual Monitor on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions minding us of our duty, and checking us, if afterwards we prove like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who <hi>ſoon forgat the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 106.13.</note> And the truth is, a Chriſtians Note-book is uſually a more faithfull regiſter than his heart, and 'tis eaſier for the Divel to blot a good reſolution out of our mindes, than out of our books.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Labour to know and underſtand well, and often remember, wherein conſiſts the life of true and real Religion; there be ſo many things in the world that pretend to be Religion, and leſs deſerve that name, than the picture of a man deſerves the name of a man, that 'tis an eaſie miſtake, to nouriſh an enemy to Religion inſtead of Religion, unleſs we be ſerious and wary, and more apt to regard the characters which the Scriptures give, of real Religion, than haſty to take up the forms and fancies of men inſtead of Religion. I have read of a young <hi>French</hi> Lady, who obſerving the glorious pomp and ſplendour of a Popiſh Proceſſion, cryed out, How fine a Religion is ours in compariſon of the <hi>Hugonots?</hi> a ſpeech ſuiting her age and quality; but indeed if Religion did conſiſt in ſuch things, the queſtion I have in hand would fall to the ground, for there could then be no exerciſe of Religion among thoſe who would not admit of ſuch pompous ſolemnities. Let us therefore be often remembring, that the Religion of the Goſpel conſiſts in
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:46545:308"/> 
               <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> 
               <hi>peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt;</hi> in <hi>denying ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and worldly luſts, and living ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2.12, 13,</note> 
               <hi>and ſo looking for that bleſſed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1.27.</note> 
               <hi>and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> in <hi>viſiting the fatherleſſe and widowes in their affliction, and keeping our ſelves unſpotted from the world.</hi> He that hath a precious Jewell which he would ſecure, muſt be able to diſtinguiſh it well from a counterfeit ſtone; leſt he neglect his Jewell and ſpend, his care and pains upon a glittering glaſſe foyſted into the room of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In all your actions be often fixing your eye upon your great end; be often asking your ſelves what is the work and buſineſſe for which God ſent me into the world? which lyes in three words: 1. Honour God. 2. Save your ſouls. 3. Do good to others. Be often minding your ſelves that you have a better Trade to drive than for the corruptible riches of this world, even for the <hi>pearl of great price,</hi> the eternall happineſſe of your ſouls. Religion is the way to Heaven, and he that doth not often eye his journeys end, and conſider, whether the way he takes, do lead unto his end, is never like to keep long in the right way; but now he that often with ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe conſiders with himſelf that the God who made him expects to be honoured by him; that the ſecuring his ſouls welfare is his grand concernment; and that to ſave the ſoul of one ſinner is a greater good than to ſave a Countrey from drowning, or a City from burning, and therefore on all occaſions asks himſelf, how may I mannage ſuch a buſineſſe ſo as to honour God and promote the good of mine own and other mens ſouls? How may I proſecute ſuch an affair without prejudicing the grand deſign of my life? This man is like to ſecure Religion in his ſoul.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Live up to the profeſſed principles of your Religion; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be a greater glory to God, honour to your Religion, and ſecurity to your own ſouls to live according to, than to argue and diſpute for your Religion; for moſt certain it is that ſelf-love, worldly intereſt, pride, paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may urge men to argue eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Chriſtian or Proteſtant Religion, whereas nothing but love to God, and care of our own ſouls, and charity to the ſouls of others, can make a man live according to the principles of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and as it is with the principle of naturall life, it is not made more lively, active and vigorous by arguing and diſputing wherein it doth conſiſt, and what are the proper acts of it, but by putting it forth in the due acts and exerciſes of that life; even ſo the principle
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:46545:308"/> of ſpirituall life in the ſoul, gets no ſtrength by zealous and hot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing, what and which is the true Religion, and which be true and proper acts of Religion, but by humble practice of what we know to be Religion; not but that it is both lawfull and commendable to be able to underſtand and defend the grounds and principles of our Religion, and all the holy exerciſes of it, but I only caution againſt letting that ſap run out in unfruitfull ſuckers, which ſhould nouriſh the fruit-bearing branches.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Be the more carefull to obſerve and cloſe with the inward ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Gods Spirit in your hearts, moving you to prayer, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When you are in <hi>a valley of viſion,</hi> you will have many calls and motions from without to hear the Word, and pray, and receive the Sacrament, but when you are abroad in a land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, God muſt not only be your <hi>best,</hi> but your <hi>only</hi> friend, by his Spirit to jog and ſtir you up to holy duties; and therefore it doth more than ordinarily concern us, at a ſuch time, not to ſend away Gods Spirit grieved with our backwardneſſe to that which is our own concernment.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Obſerve and keep a regiſter or diary of Gods mercies and your own ſins; that you may be often minded what God hath been to you, and what you have been to him; with how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand kindneſſes he hath obliged you, and with how many thouſand ſins you have diſobliged him; When we enjoy publick Ordinances we may there be often minded both of Gods goodneſſe to us and our ſinfulneſſe againſt him; and ſo may have our hearts ſtirred up to have very good thoughts of God, and very low thoughts of our ſelves: but when we want publick Ordinances we ſhould labour to ſupply that want, by a more ſtrict obſervation and recording, both the one and the other; that by reviewing our regiſter we may be enabled to affect our ſouls ſutably, either to praiſe the Lord, or abaſe our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Lay a charge upon your ſelves to ſleep and awake with the thoughts of God, and eternity upon your ſouls; and indeed though this is exceeding uſefull for all men, yet moſt of all for thoſe who are deprived of Ordinances. 'Tis ſure that the ſame truths which at firſt work upon the ſoul to the begetting grace, are of force af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to quicken grace, and make it lively and vigorous in the ſoul; and certainly the belief of what God is in himſelf and to us, and the thoughts of eternity, have a great force to perſwade careleſſe ſinners to ſober and ſerious conſideration, the neceſſary inſtrument
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:46545:309"/> by which grace and a ſpirit of true and reall Religion is begot in the ſoul; and therefore when we want thoſe publick Ordinances which might be often preſenting theſe great truths to our ſouls, it will be of great uſe to charge our ſelves more ſeverely with the daily ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Take heed (as for your life) of indulging any ſecret ſin; for that will keep down the life of Religion in the midſt of all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and therefore much more in the want of them; a ſecret diſeaſe in the body which ſpends upon the ſtock of the radicall moyſture, will keep a man from being lively and vigorous, though he have plenty of very good nouriſhing food, much more will it endanger one in a famine; even ſo a ſecret ſin lodged within, and indulged, will weaken and enervate the principle of Religion in the ſoul amidſt the fulleſt proviſion of Goſpel-Ordinances, much more when there is a famine or ſcarcity of the bread of life. A Tradeſman that hath ſome ſecret vent, where his eſtate runs waſt, may prove a beggar in the midſt of daily incomes by a good Trade, much more if he ſpends upon a dead ſtock; and ſo a man who ſpends the ſtrength of his ſoul in ſome cloſe and ſecret ſin, may prove a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all beggar in the fulleſt Trade of Goſpel-Ordinances, and though he have daily incomes of convictions, informations, reproofs, counſels, ſollicitations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from publick Ordinances; much more in the want of them; and therefore they who value the life of Religion, or the life of their ſouls, muſt take heed of indulging ſecret ſins.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Be the more carefull often to feel the pulſe of thine own ſoul; we uſe to ſay, every man at a competent age is either a fool or a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and though he be a fool indeed, who when he needs and may have wiſer Phyſicians will truſt to himſelf, yet when we cannot have others, a man ſhould the more ſtudy himſelf, and the oftener try his own pulſe; and truly he is but a babe in ſpirituall things that is not ſomething of a Phyſician to himſelf; and though we ſhould not truſt our own skill or experience, where we need and may have the help of others, yet when we are deprived of them, we ſhould the more diligently converſe with our own ſouls, and be the oftener trying how our pulſe beats towards God, and Heaven, and the things of another life.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Be ſo much the more in private ſecret prayer, reading, and meditation; when we want the ſhowrs of publick Ordinances, we ſhould the more diligently uſe the watring pot, and water our ſouls
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:46545:309"/> 
               <hi>with our foot</hi> (as the phraſe is concerning <hi>Egypt</hi>) Deut. 11.10. If our lot ſhould be caſt where there be no publick Markets where Corn might be bought, every one would plow and ſow, reap and thraſh in his own grounds: Even ſo, if we ſhould live where there be no publick Goſpel-Ordinances, where the Truths of the Goſpel are not publickly to be had, where we cannot partake of the labours of the Goſpel-Miniſtry than it would concern us to be the more diligent in plowing, and ſowing, in reaping and thraſhing by our own private endeavours; and I think it would be fit for us in ſuch a condition, to ſpend that time at leaſt in private duties, which others ſpend in ſuperſtitious or Idolatrous ſervices; let not us think much to give God and our ſouls that time, which others give to their own ſuperſtitious fancies.</p>
            <p n="12">12. In the uſe of all private helps, act faith in God, as being able to ſupply the want of outward means by the gracious influence of his good and holy Spirit. When there was no rain from heaven, God could cauſe a miſt to ariſe and water the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.6. even ſo if the Lord ſhould bring us whore there be no ſhowres of publick Ordinances, he can ſtir up in our ſouls thoſe holy and heavenly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, which ſhall again drop down like an heavenly dew upon the face of our ſouls, and keep up an holy verdure and freſhneſs upon the face of our ſouls. <hi>Aegypt</hi> is ſaid to have no rain,<note place="margin">Terra non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diga Jovis.</note> but God makes it fruitfull by the oveflowing of its own River <hi>Nilus;</hi> and truly if God bring any true beleever into a ſpiritual <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where the rain of publick Ordinances doth not fall, he can cauſe ſuch a flow of holy and heavenly thoughts and meditations as ſhall make the ſoul very fruitfull in a good and an holy life; and therefore we ſhould oft in ſuch a condition believingly remember, that if we do our endeavour, by private prayer, meditation, reading, and ſuch like, God is able and will, in the want of publick Ordinances, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the life of Religion in our ſouls, by private helps.</p>
            <p>We proceed now to the ſecond Queſtion contained in the general caſe. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What ſhould believing Chriſtians do to preſerve their outward concernments among perſecuting enemies, without hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Religion?</p>
            <p>Now this queſtion will reſolve it ſelf into two particular Queries,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What ſhould ſuch do to ſecure themſelves from ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What ſhould they do to encourage themſelves againſt and
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:46545:310"/> ſupport in ſufferings. The ſumme of what may be ſaid to the firſt Query, I ſuppoſe to be comprized in that counſel of our Lord Jeſus, who was Wiſdome it ſelf, and Innocency it ſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10 16. <hi>Behold I ſend you forth as ſheep in the midſt of Wolves; be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſe as Serpents, and harmleſs as Doves;</hi> the Serpents wiſdome joyned with the Doves innocency are the true Chriſtians beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; to each of which I ſhall ſpeak ſomething.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Get ſpiritual Prudence and Wiſdome to ſecure from ſuffering where we have not a clear and ſufficient call. The Heathens hinted wiſdome as well as ſtrength to be needfull for a Souldier, when they appointed the Warlike Goddeſs <hi>Pallas</hi> to be the Patroneſs of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; a Souldier may and ought to guard himſelf, and by winding and turning his body avoid the enemies blow, ſo long as he doth not turn his back, forſake the field, or betray his truſt; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt, by any lawfull means guard himſelf from ſuffering; and by any juſt compliance, or ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping aſide, or giving back, avoid a blow or make a fair retreat, ſo long as he keeps the Field, and doth not turn his back upon, nor give up a good, and a juſt cauſe for fear of ſuffering. Hence the Apoſtle adviſeth, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Walk in wiſdome toward them that are without,</hi> that is, walk as thoſe that have wiſely fixt upon a good end, and do uſe the moſt proper and likely means to attain that end. Now this general direction will branch it ſelf forth into theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do not raſhly and unneceſſarily provoke thoſe that have power to do you a miſchief; it is not wiſdome to ſtir in a waſps neſt, nor by bloody colours to provoke a wilde Bull; and certainly our life; and the comforts and relations in this world, are ſuch real and great bleſſings, that they are not to be ſacrificed to an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, nor caſt away, but upon the moſt ſerious conſideration, and real neceſſity; and certainly when our Lord Jeſus directed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if perſecuted in one <hi>City,</hi> to flye to another, he never intended they ſhould throw themſelves into the jaws of roaring Lions, nor provoke Bears and Tygers to tear them in pieces, nor leave the quiet habitation of <hi>Sion</hi> to ſeek perſecution, and court a Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome among Pagans and Infidels. The holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was as willing to dye for the Name of Chriſt as any,<note place="margin">Act. 21.13.</note> and was therefore by his love and zeal urged to go into the Theater at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> yet he took the prudent counſel and advice of his Friends, not to venture himſelf, nor by his preſence provoke the enraged multitude, <hi>Act.</hi>
               <pb n="647" facs="tcp:46545:310"/> 19.31. and afterward he made uſe of his Kinſmans help to ſecure his life from thoſe who had bound themſelves with an oath to kill him, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.16. and at laſt appeals to <hi>Caeſar</hi> to avoid the miſchief deſigned againſt him by the <hi>Jews,</hi> Act. 25.10. This piece of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual prudence cauſed the primitive Chriſtians to abſtain from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning the Temples of the heathen, and reviling their gods; and therefore they choſe to diſcover to them the vanity of their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries from the Writings and Records of their own Prophets, and with the greateſt love and ſweetneſs that could be; yea this was ſo evident in <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, that the Town-clark of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was able to be his, and his fellow-Chriſtian Compurgator in this matter, <hi>Act.</hi> 19 37. <hi>Ye have brought hither thoſe men which are neither robbers of Churches</hi> (or as the original, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>ſacrilegious perſons) nor yet blasphemers of your goddeſs;</hi> and therefore that which <hi>Joſephus</hi> accounts one of <hi>Moſes</hi> Laws, <hi>that none ſhould blaſpheme the Religion of another,</hi> though it be not a general duty (as appears by <hi>Elijahs</hi> mocking and ſcoffing at the God and religion of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.27.) yet it holds good here as a rule of prudence, to avoid needleſs provoking of thoſe that are without. And in this caſe I take this to be a ſure rule, whatever act of ours hath rationally a greater likelihood to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, harden and enrage the hearts of men, rather than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and convert, is a fruit of indiſcretion, not of Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; a piece of folly, not a part of our duty. It was certainly a favour from God when he inclined the heart of <hi>Trajane</hi> to order his Proconſul <hi>Plinius Secundus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin. Sec. Ep. l. 10.</hi> Conquirendi non ſunt, ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferantur &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guantur, puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endi ſunt.</note> deſiring to know his pleaſure in the caſe, that when any were brought before him, and accuſed to be Chriſtians, he ſhould puniſh them according to Law, but ſhould not induſtriouſly ſearch them out; if now any ſhould have ruſhed into the Judges preſence, and taken the Devils work out of his hands (who is the accuſer of the Brethren) it would ſurely have been a ſinfull undervaluing the favour of God in that relaxation of their perſecution. But now this advice muſt be bounded with a word of caution, for as we ſhould take heed leſt our zeal degenerate into ambition, and fooliſh vain-glory in ſuffering; ſo on the other ſide, leſt our prudence and Chriſtian wiſdome turn to ſinful craft and policy, while to avoid the ſtroak of perſecution, we take up the Devils buckler of unlawfull practiſes. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was not bound to go into the high Prieſts hall, and proclaim himſelf a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Jeſus, but he was obliged not to deny and forſwear it when challenged with it; and ſo though I am not alway bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:46545:311"/> my faith and Religion, yet am I engaged never to diſown it, and therefore we muſt take heed of that which <hi>Elihu</hi> charged <hi>Job</hi> with, <hi>Job</hi> 36.21. the chooſing <hi>iniquity rather than affliction;</hi> and therefore when fear or covetouſneſs would urge us to ſin, rather than ſuffer, let us remember, againſt our fears, that 'tis a more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing to fall into the hands of the living God, than dying men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12. and againſt our earthly deſires, let us remember, that if we gain the whole world, and loſe our own ſouls, we ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable loſers by the bargain, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. On the other ſide, when ambition, vain-glory or humour would urge us to unneceſſary ſufferings, let us remember, that God who is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it ſelf, <hi>hath no pleaſure in fools,</hi> Eccl. 5 4. nor delights in thoſe ſacrifices which are not preſented to him by prudent conſideration and ſober reſolution, but by the folly of a precipitate zeal; and however where the heart is right and full of love, God may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the love, and pardon the weakneſs, yet he no way delights in the ſufferings which men bring upon themſelves unneceſſarily, by raſh, imprudent carriage, whereby they betray their lives and liberties to the luſts and rage of men, and draw on their enemies to blood and cruelty, and upbraid the wiſdome of thoſe who are not ſo raſh, as being leſs real to God and Chriſt, and make others have hard thoughts of that Religion which cannot conſiſt with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wiſdome.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be much in the exerciſe of thoſe acts of true Religion which are beautiful in the eyes of all, even the worſt of men; the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> intimates the ſecurity of an evidently good and holy life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. <hi>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</hi> the chief pieces of Chriſtian Religion are ſuch as Papiſts, Turks and Infidels muſt needs acknowledge to be good; <hi>To viſite the fatherleſs and widows in their affliction; To wrong no man; To do to others whatever we would that others ſhould do to us:</hi> Now when we cannot without danger exerciſe ſome other (perhaps more queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable) parts of Chriſtian Religion, then 'tis good to be ſo much the more in the practice of theſe undoubted pieces of a Chriſtian life, and zeal in theſe things will force thoſe without to approve, whereas zeal in arguing for, or in practiſing other things may cauſe them to hate and perſecute us; zeal in arguing and diſputing brings on evil words and evil actions, but zeal in the practice of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable duties, produceth good deeds in our ſelves, and forceth good thoughts and good words, if not good deeds from others.
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:46545:311"/> In a word, hot diſputing, and cold living, or zeal in ſmaller, and luke-warmneſs in greater matters, is the ruine of grace in our ſelves, the confirming of ſin in others, and the needleſs hazarding our outward concernments and betraying them raſhly to the violence of wicked and ungodly men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In your converſe with thoſe who are without, chuſe moſtly to inſiſt upon common, and acknowledged principles, rather than controverted points; if I were to live among, and converſe with Papiſts, I would chuſe much rather to urge them to abſtain from lying, drunkenneſs, malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to have good thoughts of God, to have a continual ſenſe of their dependance upon him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore continually to recommend themſelves unto him by holy prayer, to be meek and patient, and charitable, rather than to diſpute how many Sacraments there be, or how the bread and the wine is the body and blood of Chriſt; for good counſel, and ſober exhortations ſpeak love to mens ſouls, whereas diſputes and arguings are uſually thought to proceed onely from love to our own notions, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to oppoſe others; and indeed if men did not place too much of their Religion in oppoſing others, they might much more ſafely, and much more profitably converſe with thoſe of different opinions, yea of different Religions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When you do touch upon controverted points, rather enquire and propound, than poſitively aſſert, and violently oppoſe; though I judge the Maſſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> as by them uſed, to be a piece of as groſſe Idolatry, as the world can ſhew, yet were I to converſe among Papiſts I would not fall foul upon them as the groſſeſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but as more deſiring truth ſhould be honoured, than they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, I would calmly and meekly propound my reaſons as grounds of doubting, rather than clear demonſtrations; for ſure it is, that a ſudden and violent aſſault, will cauſe an adverſary to gather up his ſtrength, as violently to oppoſe, whereas a calm propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of reaſons, or doubts may work him to a ſerious conſideration, which is the firſt ſtep to the diſcovery of error and acknowledging of truth; for the one kindles a deſire of knowing, the other, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of oppoſing, yea of perſecuting.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When you think your ſelves bound to reprove the ſins of others, let it be done with a due conſideration of the circumſtances of time, place and perſons; and indeed there's ſcarce any part of a Chriſtians converſe with others, that more requires prudence and wiſdome, than that of reproving others; and great care is to be had
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:46545:312"/> that a reproof may at the leaſt be well taken, if not hearkned to, and that it may do the reproover no hurt, if it do the reprooved no good.</p>
            <p n="6">6. On all occaſions expreſſe a willingneſſe to do for the beſt; to believe as others believe, and to do as others do, if you could ſee ſufficient ground and reaſon for it: and indeed this may be a great help and ſecurity; for obſtinacy is uſually made one eſſential part of an Heretick, and then, he that is heartily willing to cloſe with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry revealed truth, may be in an errour, but cannot be an Heretick; and therefore every expreſſion of a mind not obſtinately bent upon its taken up notions, nor doting upon its own conceptions, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richt with an ingenuous freedome to acknowledge its miſtakes, and own truth when once clearly diſcovered, though formerly diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is like ſo much water upon the fire of rage kindled in the hearts of perſecuting enemies to quench or abate it: for to the reaſon of any that will but conſider, it cannot but appear moſt unreaſonable, to urge a perſon to believe what he cannot ſee any ground for, or to do what he would be willing to do, if it were not ſin, that is, a provoking God, and hazarding his own eternal welfare.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Be ſure to uſe no means to ſecure from perſecution or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the enjoyment of publick Ordinances, but ſuch as are well-pleaſing to a good, and a holy God; 'tis not long ſince it was the peculiar honour of the Popiſh Faction, to depoſe or murder Kings, blow up Parliaments, ſubvert States and Kingdomes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their liberty, or ſecure themſelves from ſuffering; and if any others have ventured upon ſuch practices, I hope God hath taught them by his providence, what they would not learn from his word, that affliction is rather to be choſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n than ſin, and that 'tis better to wait upon him in the way of his Judgements (that is, in a way of duty) than to out-run God, and think to ſecure our ſelves by ſinfull and unjuſtifiable courſes. Let thoſe therefore who proſeſs to believe that their God is a God hearing prayer, and that bottles up the tears of his people, and is able to do what he pleaſeth, let them account prayers and tears their beſt arms, ſeeing they call in that God whoſe power extends as far as his will.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Arm your ſelves with a ſevere patience and a ſteady reſolution to bear leſſer affronts and injuries; thoſe Chriſtians were in ſuch a condition as we are now ſpeaking of, whom the Apoſtle mindes, that they had <hi>need of patience,</hi> Heb. 10 36. Let it be our wiſdome therefore to get a ſtock of that which will be ſo needfull for us, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:46545:312"/> is alway a part of our duty, but in this caſe it is alſo an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our prudence; for he is a fool that will hazard the beating out of his brains, rather than bear a fillip.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Be much in prayer to that God who alone can ſecure from ſuffering, ſit for ſuffering, ſtrengthen under, and infinitely reward after we have ſuffered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let the Serpents wiſdome be ſeconded with the Doves harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and innocency; walk ſo honeſtly and inoffenſively that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men may be put hard to it, to finde an occaſion to quarrel or wrong you; this was remarkable in <hi>Daniel,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Chap</hi> 6.4. this was the Apoſtles direction, 1 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 4.12. <hi>Walk honeſtly toward thoſe that are without;</hi> and it was according to his practice, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. <hi>And herein do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have alwayes a conſcience void of offence toward God, and toward men.</hi> Now this Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency or ſimplicity ought to be like a thred to run through the whole courſe of our converſe with others; we ſhould neither injure the perſon, good name, eſtate, friend, or any thing which an other may call his; if the Lamb among Wolves and Foxes begin to butt, and contend, no wonder if theſe ſoon bite and devour; we ſhould be ſo honeſt and plain-hearted in our Promiſes, Contracts, Covenants, and dealings with others, that they may reverence our Religion as teaching us to do the beſt things, and ſuffer the worſt, and not hate our Religion, as being onely a deſign to make us the better able to deceive and injure others. 'Twould be no ſmall part of our ſecurity if our carriage towards others might ſpeak for us that which the Poet makes <hi>Achilles</hi> ſpeak concerning himſelf, and his Tutor <hi>Chiron, Jeſus Chriſt is my Teacher, and he hath learnt me to uſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and honeſty in all my manners.</hi> But now if neither of theſe two will ſecure us from ſuffering, but Gods providence doth call us to a publick owning of him, and the Religion of the Goſpel, we muſt then joyn the Lions courage to the wiſdome of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and the innocency of the Dove, that we may be imboldned to look the greateſt da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ger in the face, rather than turn our back upon God and Chriſt, and the Religion of the Goſpel. And this brings me to the ſecond branch of the latter part of the Caſe, How ſhould believers encourage themſelves againſt ſufferings?</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which take theſe brief D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rections:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be often remembring how infinitely more worth the ſoul is than the body;<note place="margin">Luke 16.26. Phil. 3.21.</note> be often weighing in the ſcales of ſober and ſerious conſideration, a <hi>precious ſoul</hi> againſt a <hi>vile body;</hi> and then minde
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:46545:313"/> thy ſelf, that the worſt which perſecuting enemies can do, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a corruptible body, but the worſt which God can do is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thine immortal ſoul. Chriſt arms his Diſciples againſt fear of ſuffering by this conſideration, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul, but rather fear him which is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Think how inconſiderable time is compared with Eternity; ſpend your thoughts upon the difference, vaſt and inconceiveable, between thoſe two; the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> Rom. 8.18. The Apoſtle compares himſelf to one that hath been caſting up an account, where on one ſide he meets with nothing but cyphers, or ſmall petty ſummes; but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide findes thouſands and millions, and then cryes out alas, the one is not to be compared with the other! Thus the Apoſtle findes <hi>light and momentary afflictions,</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory</hi> on the other ſide, as we finde him expreſſing himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 4.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Remember that the welfare of the body doth depend upon the welfare of the ſoul; not indeed in this world, for here his body may be well, and in good plight, fat and flouriſhing, well fed and cloathed, whoſe ſoul is poor and naked, ſick and wounded, in a ſad and deplorable condition; and on the other ſide, a poor beggarly ſick <hi>Lazarus,</hi> may have a ſoul fed with Royal and heavenly Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and cloathed with better Robes than Purple and Ermine; but then the eternal welfare of the body depends upon the eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the ſoul; 'tis bound up in the life and welfare of the ſoul, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> life is ſaid to be bound up in <hi>Benjamins,</hi> Gen 44 30. and therefore you cannot ſecure the welfare of the outward man, by betraying and caſting away that which is the life and welfare of the inward man.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Remember that you can ſuffer nothing in this world, but Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuffered the ſame, or worſe; The Lord Jeſus arms his Diſciples againſt ſufferings by this conſideration, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.20. and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> having experienced it himſelf, adviſeth the believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Looking unto Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> Now this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration will ſuggeſt to us,</p>

<pb n="653" facs="tcp:46545:313"/> Chriſts ſufferings aſſure us, that the pureſt and whiteſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, may be dyed red in its own blood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the greateſt ſufferings make us never the leſs amiable in the eyes of God, for then Chriſt Jeſus the onely begotten Son of God, in whom he was alway well-pleaſed, would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We can ſuffer nothing but what our God, our Friend, our Father, knows we ſuffer, and knows that a ſuffering condition is the beſt for us. When poor Chriſtians are kept by the bloody Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in dark Holes and Caves from the eyes of all the world, they cannot be kept from the eye of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13. <hi>I know thy works, and where thou dwelleſt, even where Satans ſeat is;</hi> this was the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement which Chriſt gave his perſecuted Church of <hi>Pergamos;</hi> thy condition is known to that God whoſe heart is as tender, as his eye piercing; and whoſe arm can reach as far as his eye, and whoſe wiſdome knows how to direct the ſufferings of every beleever for his own, his Churches, and that beleevers real good.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Be often comparing God and creatures together, that great God who ſuffers in, and with his ſuffering people, and thoſe little ſmall things called devils and men that bring ſufferings upon them; make thy ſoul to know and underſtand the difference between the little trifling bubble promiſes of the world, and the great precious, ſolid and maſſie promiſes of God; and let faith tell thee, that the threatnings of a raging Devil, a ſtorming <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> or a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious multitude, are but the noyſe of a Pot-gun, if compared with the thunder of Gods dreadfull Threatnings. Remember what God ſaith to his afflicted Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12. <hi>Who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man that ſhall dye, and of the ſon of man which ſhall be made as graſs? and forgetteſt the Lord thy Maker, &amp;c?</hi> In a word, think thus with thy ſelf, man cannot do all that he ſeems able to do, nor all that he reſolves and boaſts that he will do, but God can do all that he hath ſaid he will do, and he will do for his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervants more than they can hope or think. Let us heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God can eaſily recompence us for whatever we may loſe for him; but all the creatures in the world are not able to make amends for that, which Apoſtacy from God will deprive us of; Oh Sirs, could we but heartily believe this, what a ſorry temptation would perſecution be? If this faith were ſtrong, perſecution would be exceeding weak; if faith could ſee, men and devils able to do nothing, and God able to do all things, then perſecution would be
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:46545:314"/> able to do nothing, and ſuch a faith would be able to do, and to ſuffer all things.</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſpoken to both the parts of this practical Caſe of Conſcience, and ſhall now cloſe up all with a word of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That if it be ſuch a real ground of trouble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then let us make it our earneſt prayer to God, that our Land may ſtill be a <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and a <hi>Valley of Viſion,</hi> and not an <hi>Egypt,</hi> or the <hi>vale of the ſhadow of death,</hi> that we may ſtill enjoy the Ordinances of the Goſpel, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and ſociety of good men; that our lot may never fall among <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Scorpions or pricking briars, and grieving thorns, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.6. and 28.24. Let us heartily pray for that bleſſedneſs mentioned <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. <hi>That the Lord may chuſe us, and cauſe us to approach unto him, that we may dwell in his Courts, and be ſatisfied with the goodneſs of his houſe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What <hi>hypocriſie</hi> is: Much of the nature of a thing is many times diſcovered in its name; the name is a brief deſcription.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>hypocrite</hi> properly ſignifies an <hi>actor</hi> or <hi>ſtagepl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yer,</hi> a perſonater of other men in their ſpeech, habit, and action. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word ſignifieth both a <hi>wicked</hi> man and a <hi>deceiver.</hi> And it is obſerved, that thoſe whom <hi>David</hi> the devouteſt man called <hi>wicked, Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt man calls <hi>fools,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> the moſt upright man calls <hi>hypocrites:</hi> all is but one and the ſame thing under divers names.</p>
            <p>Hypocriſie then is but a feigning vertue and piety it ſeems to put on, and vice and impiety it conceals and would ſeem to put off. It is indeed <hi>vice in a vizor:</hi> the face is vice, but virtue is the vizor. The <hi>form</hi> and nature of it is <hi>imitation:</hi> the ends are <hi>vain glory,</hi> to be ſeen of men, or ſome <hi>gain</hi> or <hi>carnal</hi> reſpects.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>groſſe</hi> hypocriſie whereby men pretend to the good they <hi>know</hi> they have not: and there is a formall <hi>cloſe</hi> hypocriſie, whereby men deceive others and themſelves too; are hypocrites and do <hi>not know it:</hi> In this caſe it is probable the <hi>Phariſee</hi> was,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. Mat. 25.</note> and thoſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the <hi>five fooliſh Virgins,</hi> and all <hi>formall</hi> Chriſtians that are not regenerated by the ſpirit, nor put into Chriſt by faith.</p>
            <p>This is a ſubtle evill, a ſecret poyſon, a cloſe contagion; and here it is infinite mercy and grace that we do not all ſplit and periſh: and if we can ſcape this, if we are indeed ſincere, we are out of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt danger of all the leaven of hypocriſie. To direct you to find out, and to purge out this, ſhall be my eſpeciall endeavour at this time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How is hypocriſie reſembled by <hi>leaven?</hi> Briefly thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Leaven is hardly diſcerned from good dough by the ſight, and as hardly is hypocriſie diſtinguiſhed from piety: <hi>You outwardly
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:46545:316"/> appear righteous unto men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23.18. 1 Cor. 5.6.</note> 
               <hi>but within you are full of hypocriſie and iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Leaven is very ſpreading, <hi>a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump:</hi> and ſo it is a great deal of miſchief hypocriſie doth, it ſpreads over all the man, and all his duties, parts, performances, leavens all, as we may obſerve, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66.3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Leaven is of a ſour taſt, and ingratefull ſmell; ſo is hypocriſie to God and man: <hi>I will ſpread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your ſolemn aſſemblies:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 2.3.</note> all were <hi>leavened</hi> with hypocriſie, and were accounted and ſavoured but as <hi>dung</hi> in the noſtrils of the Lord. How odious and loathſome was that ſervice of <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> both to the holy Ghoſt and to the Church, becauſe it was leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with hypocriſie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Leaven is of a ſwelling nature, it extends and puffs up the dough: and ſo doth hypocriſie; it is all for the <hi>praiſe of men:</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees were all for preheminence, chief places, chief ſeats, chief appellations, to be called <hi>Rabbi, Rabbi:</hi> and if others will not admire and over value them, they will admire and advance themſelves:<note place="margin">Mat. 18. Luk. 16.14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>I am not as this Publicane. You are they that juſtifie your ſelves, but God knoweth your heart, for that which is highly eſteemed among men, is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> They highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of themſelves, they juſtified themſelves: they derided Chriſt for not having the ſame thoughts of them: Pride and vain-glory is the inſeparable companion, if not the mother of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Why is it called the leaven of the <hi>Phariſees?</hi> Becauſe they were leavened with it to purpoſe, they were exact and ſupereminent in this diveliſh art of perſonating and counterfeiting to the life. The devill indeed is the arch-hypocrite of the world, <hi>transforming himſelf into an Angell of light:</hi> his firſt-born in this generation are the Scribes and Phariſees; his next born the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> ſo like their predeceſſors the Phariſees, that a man may believe that Chriſt looked ſo farre as to them in <hi>Matth</hi> 23. and ſtrook at them through the Phariſees ſides, that they were indeed the types, but the Pope, Cardinals, Prelates, and Jeſuites, the antitype. Their Doctrines are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like leavened, they both ſet up traditions, ſuperſtitious cuſtoms and forms, againſt and above the Word of God, when once they come in competition: they both would ordinarily ſuſpend and diſpence with Gods commands, but moſt rigorouſly impoſe their own, and that under ſevere paenalties; and both upon the account of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:46545:316"/> holineſſe, and high actings of devotion. And ſo for their converſation, there was groſſe hypocriſie in all to be ſeen; prayed in corners of the ſtreets, gave alms openly,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.4, 5, 6.</note> disfigured themſelves that they might appear to faſt. So the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> (if we may beleeve ſome of themſelves being converted) and many of the <hi>Saeculars</hi> that know them well enough, affect the name, but hate the reallity of true piety and devotion. They would be accounted as <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſaid of them, <hi>Timothies</hi> at home in the Colledge, <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> in the pulpit, and <hi>Auguſtines</hi> in diſputation, this they would be accounted, though it be <hi>nomen inane &amp; crimen immane,</hi> they would have the name though not the thing; for that is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the leaven of the Phariſees which is hypocriſie.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wherein is this leaven of hypocriſie ſo dangerous, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and people, ought firſtly, chiefly to beware of it? A very little and briefly of that:</p>
            <p>There is great danger <hi>of</hi> it, and great danger <hi>by</hi> it.</p>
            <p>There is great danger <hi>of</hi> it: 1. For we have the ground of the matter in our ſelves, <hi>hearts deceitfull above all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 17.9.</note> 
               <hi>and deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked; who can know</hi> thy wickedneſſe? <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, and try the reynes,</hi> &amp;c. As if none beſides the Lord knew the bottomleſſe depths and deceits of the heart. In the heart are thoſe luſts and affections, that feed and foment all the hypocriſie in the world: pride, vain-glory, concupiſcence, carnall wiſdome; were it not for theſe, there would not be an hypocrite living.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Devill watcheth night and day to ſet fire to this towe, he is fitted to the purpoſe, and filled with raging deſire, to comply with a filthy heart, and to ingender this ſpurious offspring of hypocriſie. He hath in a readineſſe his wiles, and his depths, his baits and his ſnares; and for a falſe heart, hath falſe wayes, falſe Doctrines, falſe faiths, falſe ſeaſons, falſe ends and aims, <hi>vix caret effectu,</hi> when two ſuch be agreed to ſuch a purpoſe, hardly will they be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And that we may not be ſecure, there are before our eyes and in our view dreadfull examples: <hi>Baalam</hi> a great Prophet, <hi>Judas</hi> an Apoſtle familiar with Chriſt: <hi>Saul, Jehu, Herod,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Kings: <hi>Five Virgins</hi> conſpicuous and moſt confident: <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra</hi> eminent converts: <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and in ſome degree Martyrs: it may grieve and make a tender heart tremble, to think, what they became, and what is become of them. To teach him that ſtandeth to take heed leaſt he fall, and all
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:46545:317"/> of us to our dying day, to <hi>beware of the leaven of the Phariſees which is hypocriſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And there is great danger <hi>by</hi> it: 1. The loſſe of all that is done:<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> Chriſt will ſay as to that young man, <hi>yet wanteſt thou one thing,</hi> ſincerity: wouldſt thou have Heaven too? why then didſt thou all things for <hi>the praiſe of men? thou haſt thy reward,</hi> and art over-paid:<note place="margin">Mat. 7.23.</note> 
               <hi>depart from me you that work iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Fruſtrating of hopes, great hopes, hopes of glory and Heaven, and eſcaping eternall miſery:<note place="margin">oIb 8.13.</note> all theſe hopes muſt <hi>periſh</hi> to the <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite:</hi> periſh like a ſhip at the very mouth of the haven, periſh whiles they are crying <hi>Lord, Lord:</hi> periſh into everlaſting horrour, and eternall diſpair.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Full detection, and manifeſting of them in the ſight and face of all the world,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.2.</note> for <hi>there is nothing covered that ſhall not be revealed, nor hid that ſhall not be known:</hi> the vizor will be then taken off which was feigned ſanctity; and the face will appear which was indeed double iniquity, and for going about to couſin God, and the world, and his own ſoul, the miſerable hypocrite will be left to eternall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable confuſion. To be deteſted, and derided by God, Angels and Saints; to be inſulted on by the devils and damned to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And in Hell the hypocrite <hi>ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes; for he knew his Maſters will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12.47.</note> and pretended he was doing of it, and yet <hi>did it not.</hi> Shall he that judged others to Hell lye lower in Hell, and have more of Hell than thoſe condemned by him? ſhall it be worſe with a proud Phariſee than with a Publicane, nay a damned Publicane?<note place="margin">Mat. 24.51.</note> is Hell the portion of Hypocrites? are they the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, and all others but tennants and inmates with them? or elſe if there be a worſe place in Hell, muſt it be theirs? it muſt be ſo, for the nearer Heaven the more of Hell, and that will be the Hell of Hell to all aeternity. Surely then hypocriſie is a dangerous thing, there is exceeding danger of, and danger by this <hi>leaven of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, which is hypocriſie.</hi>

               </label> I ſhall commend but one Uſe to be made of this Doctrine at this time, and it is the <hi>beware</hi> in the Text.</p>
            <p>To ſtirre and provoke you to put forth your utmoſt care, diligence and circumſpection, to <hi>beware of this leaven of the Phariſees, which is hypocriſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I could ſhew you how much you are concerned to beware of the Phariſees leaven in doctrinals, to beware of Doctrines
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:46545:317"/> advancing any thing in man, or of man: doctrines that are derived from any other fountain, than the pure Word of God, as traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Enthuſiaſmes, impulſes, beſides or againſt the Word: do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of will-worſhip, ſuperſtition, voluntary humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines aſcribing too much to, and laying too much ſtreſſe on, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals in worſhip not inſtituted by Chriſt: doctrines of rigid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of things indifferent: doctrines that have a tendency to blind obedience and implicite faith. Whoever reads the New Teſtament, may ſoon diſcern ſuch were their doctrines, and this is the leaven of the Phariſees in doctrinals; and truly you had need to take care of this, for doctrines and principles have no ſmall influence on conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and practice.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall chooſe rather to proſecute this Uſe, by endeavouring to give an Anſwer and reſolution to two Queſtions, which together conſtitute a great and weighty Caſe of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How may we diſcover and find out this ſubtill cloſe evil of hypocriſie, and convince our own and others ſouls that we are guilty of it, and under the danger of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt here firſt premiſe ſome general <hi>Cautions,</hi> and then produce ſome particular <hi>evidences</hi> and diſcoveries of it. I ſhall not meddle at all with groſſe hypocriſie, which is uſually known both to the Hypocrite himſelf, and frequently apparent to others too. <hi>Some mens ſins are open beforehand, going before to judgement,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.24.</note> 
               <hi>and ſome men they follow after:</hi> But I ſhall labour to trace out and unkennel that <hi>latent,</hi> cloſe, and deep <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> formally <hi>ſelf-deceiving Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> whereby the Hypocrite may couſin others, and himſelf too.</p>
            <p>Here 1. I muſt premiſe theſe Cautions and Negations;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>hic labor, hoc opus,</hi> my task is very hard, my work <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Caution </seg>1</label> nice and curious; that it is very difficult to find out the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of ones own heart, much more to convince others of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie in theirs, for the <hi>heart of man is deceitfull above all things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 17 9.</note> And hence the moſt ſerious, inquiſitive, jealous, and heart-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians have uſed to call God in to their help in this work, <hi>Search me O God and know my heart, try me and know my reins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 139.23, 24.</note> &amp;c. Search my heart and try my reins, examine whether there be any way of wickedneſſe in me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That as difficult as it is, yet it is <hi>poſſible</hi> and feaſible: for we <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Caution </seg>2</label> are not commanded impoſſibilities, when we are required to <hi>ſearch and try our wayes and turn unto the Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 3.40. 2 Cor. 13.5. 1 Ioh. 3.19.</note> to examine our hearts and to <hi>prove our ſelves whether we be in the faith:</hi> whether <hi>our own hearts
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:46545:318"/> condemn us not. David, Hezekiah, Job</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. theſe all examined their own hearts, and attained thereby to a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſenſe of their own ſincerity. And we are not directed to abſurdities, when we are cautioned to <hi>beware of men,</hi> to take heed of thoſe that <hi>come in ſheeps cloathing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves.</hi> And we are not herein bid to make Brick without ſtraw, for <hi>the ſpirit of a man which is in him knoweth the things of a man,</hi>

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.10.</note> ſome think that by vertue of this gift, <hi>Peter</hi> diſcerned <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> their hypocriſie,<note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> and afterwards <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his too, which <hi>Philip</hi> could not do, as not having that gift, or ſuch a meaſure of it; but indeed there was no need of any extraordinary gift to diſcern <hi>Simon Magus</hi> by;<note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> to any man that had reaſon and but common illumination, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his hypocriſie might eaſily and clearly appear in that motion of his <hi>[Sell me this gift]</hi> Who but an hypocrite could have thought it had been to be ſold? and who but an hypocrite would have offered money for it? It was eaſie to conclude him in <hi>the gall of bitterneſſe, and the bond of iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Miniſters of the Goſpel have authority, calling, and commiſſion (and therefore gifts) to detect and bewray the guiles and wiles, the depths and deceits and ſnares of Satan, much more the workings and turnings of mens deceitfull hearts; and the Word of God (which is the main and principall weapon of their warfare) <hi>is quick and powerfull,</hi>

               <hi>a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart: and it caſts down imaginations, and brings into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi> Therefore while we have this Word and Spirit,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> it is poſſible (though difficult) to diſcover the hypocriſie of our own ſpirits, and to direct others to find out theirs.</p>
            <p>It is not a poor ſouls fearing and doubting his hypocriſie, accuſing <label type="milestone">

            <p n="3">3.

This is not granted to all, and ſeldome to any at all times, that ſo there may be a ſeaſon for the exerciſe of other graces, humility, fear and trembling, fear of ſollicitude,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.12. 2 Pet. 1.</note> and diligence in making our calling and election ſure.

The prayer conſiſts of petition and thankſgiving, both of them, not conformed to any common modell; but ſuiting the particular occaſion now before him. He bleſſeth God for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch an impreſſion upon the hearts of the people, as moved them to offer, and <hi>after this ſort</hi> to offer, ſo cheerfully, ſo generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from <hi>ver.</hi> 10, to 18. and beſeecheth God ſtill to keep their hearts in ſuch a temper, to make this holy impreſſion durable and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>O Lord God of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>keep this for ever in the imaginations,</hi> &amp;c. Where we have the inforcement of the petition and the matter of it. It is inforced from the Covenant of God, by vertue of which, he was <hi>the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iſrael,</hi> and had laid an obligement on himſelf, to have a gracious reſpect to their poſterity; hence this expreſſion is frequently uſed, being no ſmall incouragement to the faithfull, to pray for Covenant-mercies, and to pray in faith.</p>
            <p>The matter of the Petition, that which he prayes for is, that the effect which his words had upon the people might be durable and continuing, that the efficacy thereof might abide upon their ſouls, and every part thereof: that it might ſink into the depths of their hearts, and ſtick faſt there: that it might pierce through their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and <hi>imaginations</hi> into their mind and <hi>thoughts,</hi> and through their <hi>thoughts</hi> into their <hi>hearts</hi> and affections; that the Lord would continue it there, and continue it long there, even <hi>for ever.</hi>

               <hi>David</hi> was apprehenſive what a ſlippery and inconſtant thing the heart of man is, how like a deceitfull bow, to which he elſewhere compares it, how apt to ſlacken on a ſuddain, when it hath been bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any good inclinations or reſolutions, by the power of the Word, or any other Ordinance.

            <p>I muſt not proſecute this Doctrine in the uſuall method, but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it only, as leading us to the Practical Caſe at this time to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

            <p>
               <hi>What muſt be done that the influences of the Ordinances may abide upon us?</hi> By the <hi>Ordinances</hi> we underſtand thoſe principally which are publick the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer. The Text and this exerciſe leads us to have a more ſpecial reſpect to the Word, which we ſhall a little obſerve, but ſo as not to exclude the reſt. By the <hi>influence</hi> of the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> is ment the effect they have upon us, while we are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them; their gracious or comforting efficacy, that which tends to make our hearts and lives more holy or more comfortable; that whereby our ſouls are quickned, ſtrengthned, reſtored or refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By its <hi>abiding on us,</hi> underſtand the continuance of this effect af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the duty is done, that ſo the Ordinances of God be not like thoſe humane Ordinances (the Apoſtle ſpeaks of) which <hi>periſh in the uſing,</hi> Col. 2.20, 22. If you would have it ſtated clearly and more at large, take it thus; <hi>What courſe muſt we take that the gracious and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting efficacy of publick Ordinances may not onely reach us while we are imployed in them, but may continue on us afterwards; ſo as we may walk under the ſenſe and power thereof all along?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To reſolve this without further preamble, the courſe you muſt take for this purpoſe, lies in the practice of ſome things; and the avoiding of others. The things to be practiſed take notice of in theſe ſeverals:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Get new hearts, and get them daily more and more renewed; an old heart is a heart, of ſtone, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. and the hardneſſe of it is not removed but by degrees. Now that which will ſink deep into a tender heart, a heart of fleſh, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.) will glide off from an old heart as water from a ſtone, without leaving any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: and where none is left none can continue. The good ſeed which fell on ſtony ground, it ſprang up indeed, but it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not, <hi>it withered away as ſoon as it ſprang up,</hi> Luk. 8.6. but they which with an honeſt and good heart heard the word, they <hi>kept it,</hi> and brought forth fruit with patience (<hi>i. e.</hi> with perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varence,) <hi>ver.</hi> 15. the fruitfull influences of the word abode upon them: A good and honeſt heart not onely hears the word, but
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:46545:327"/> kesps it; not onely brings forth fruit, but perſiſts ſo doing. The more tender, humble, and ſpirituall the heart is, the more ſpirituall fruit and advantage doth it reap from the Ordinances, and the longer doth it continue in poſſeſſion of thoſe advantages; the leſſe the ſoul is renewed, the more reſiſtance doth it offer to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and the more they are reſiſted, the weaker is their efficacy; and the leſſe their efficacy is, the leſſe while doth it continue. A heart throughly ſanctified, is to the Ordinances like tinder, which ſoon takes fire, and is apt to keep it till it be forced out: whereas a carnall unmortified heart, is like green wood, whoſe moiſtneſſe giving check to the activity of the fire, is not ſoon kindled, and will ſoon go out, if it be not well lookt too. Naturaliſts obſerve, that tranſmutation is eaſie in ſymbolicall elements, ſuch as agree in ſome prime qualities: water is more eaſily turned into ayr than into fire. A holy and ſpirituall heart will be eaſily wrought on, by holy and ſpirituall Ordinances; for here is an agreement in qualities; and the more agreement the leſſe oppoſition, and the leſſe the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, the more eaſily will it be maſtered; the power of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances will more eaſily both take place and keep poſſeſſion. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe makes the ſoul both receptive and retentive of holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. Make it but your great buſineſſe to grow every day more holy; and it will not be ſo hard a matter, to have the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances work effectually on you, or to have their efficacy continue with you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Labour to be much affected with the Ordinances while you are imployed in them. Sleight impreſſions will be ſoon worn out: and weak influences will quickly ſpend themſelves and vaniſh. If the Ordinances have but little effect upon you, while you are under them, it is not like to laſt long: for that which is little is near to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that which is ſo near to it, may ſoon come to nothing. It is not enough that your hearts be a little warmed, but they muſt burn within you, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 24.32.) while Chriſt is ſpeaking to you, or you are ſpeaking to him; if you would have that heavenly heat to be laſting. The good ſeed miſcarried upon one ſort of ground in the parable, becauſe it had no <hi>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pneſſe of earth,</hi> Mat. 13.5, 6. it <hi>quickly withered becauſe it took no deep root.</hi> If the Ordinances pierce no further than the ſurface of the ſoul, if the work of them be but ſuperficial, if they do not penetrate into the depths of the heart: the efficacy of them is not like to continue. Therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your hearts before you draw near to God, get them ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:46545:327"/> as they may be capable of laſting influences. The Text directs us to this, O Lord keep this for ever in the imagination, &amp;c. <hi>and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their heart unto thee.</hi> Then is the heart prepared to the Lord when it is made <hi>tender,</hi> and <hi>ſenſible,</hi> and <hi>open.</hi> Bring tender hearts to the Ordinances, get them broken up beforehand, break up your fallow ground and ſow not among thorns, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.12. A tender heart drinks in divine influences, they inſinuate themſelves more eaſily into the intimate receſſes of it. That which can make no impreſſion at all upon a Flint, will ſink deep into ſoftned wax.</p>
            <p>Come with <hi>ſenſible</hi> hearts, apprehenſive of your ſpiritual wants and neceſſities; burdened with your luſts, and corruptions; pained with your inward diſtempers and ſoul-grievances. I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you any thing more effectual, to make you capable of great and laſting advantages. Such a quick ſenſe of your ſpiritual condition will <hi>open</hi> your hearts, and make them ready to receive ſo much from the Ordinances, as will not be ſoon ſpent. Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10. Now it is deſire that opens the heart, and the ſtronger the deſire is, the wider is it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: then is the ſoul wide open, when it pants and breaths after God, when it hungers and thirſts after holineſſe as appears by equivalent promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6.

Such curſory taſts may chear you a little, but they will not furniſh you with ſtrength for continual ſervice: you muſt feed and feed hungri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and come with a ſtrong appetite, that you may be capacious of much; a little will not ſerve you long.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mind the Ordinances after your uſe of them, be much in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation if you would have the efficacy of Ordinances to continue long. Be often conſidering what you have heard, what you have prayed for, what you have received and are obliged to by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. Much of Heaven and holineſſe, is engraved on theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and the ſeal is as it were ſet upon the heart, while you are
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:46545:328"/> under them: but after-conſideration lays more weight on it, and impreſſeth it deeper, and ſo makes the characters both more plain and more durable; for the deeper they are the longer will it be, ere they be defaced.</p>
            <p>Moſt men loſe their ſouls, and the beſt men loſe great advantages for their ſouls; for want of conſideration. There is a quickning, a healing a comforting, a ſtrengthning vertue, in the Ordinances; and this vertue may fall upon your ſouls, while you are imployed in them: but you cannot expect it will ſtay with you, unleſſe you fix it there, and no better way to fix it, than conſideration. This will rouze it up when it lyes dormant and unactive; this will put ſpirits into it, when it grows weak and languid; this will both dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and faſten it, yea it will heighten and improve it. <hi>My heart was hot within me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39.3.) <hi>while I was muſing the fire burned.</hi> The heart takes fire at the mind, and it is <hi>muſing</hi> or conſideration that kindles it, and keeps it in, and blows it up: thoſe ſparks which fall from heaven upon your hearts, while you are hearing, or praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they'l die, they will go out, and come to nothing unleſſe you do <gap reason="foreign">

The Word hath a ſalve for every ſoul-diſtemper, but that it may be effectual, the plaiſter muſt be laid on, and kept on too, till the cure be wrought: the Preacher may apply it, and lay it upon the diſtempered part, but it will not be kept on without medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taste,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.103. How came they to be ſtill ſo ſweet? why, <hi>they were his meditation day and night,</hi> the delicious reliſh of them ſtill continued, becauſe he kept them ſtill upon his palate, by ruminating and muſing on them.</p>
            <p>The Word of God in Scripture is as honey in the combe, there's that which is incomparably ſweeter: now by meditation you ſqueeze out this ſweetneſſe, and it will be ſtill dropping comfort and ſweet refreſhment upon your ſouls, while you are <hi>preſſing</hi> it by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.14. <hi>I write unto you young men, becauſe ye are ſtrong, and the Word of God abideth in you.</hi> If you would be ſtrong and continue ſo, the Word of God muſt <hi>abide</hi> in you; now how can it abide in you, if it have not leave to ſtay in that, which is but the portal of the ſoul, if it abide not in your mindes? You loſe all for want of conſideration, both the gracious and comforting influences
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:46545:328"/> of the Ordinances, ſlide from you through this neglect. And no wonder it is ſo great a dammage to you, ſince it is ſo great a ſin: you caſt the Word behind your backs, and throw the Ordinances at your heels, when you do not minde them after you have done with them; and will the Lord encourage any with a durable bleſſing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch guilt? will not this provoke him rather to curſe your bleſſings, and blaſt them in the bud,? Meditation is a known duty, and commonly inſiſted on, and therefore you may be tempted to ſleight it; whereas indeed upon this account, you ſhould the more regard it; for ſince it is a known duty, the neglect of it is a known ſin; now to ſay nothing how inconſiſtent it is either with grace or comfort, to live in a known ſin, how can you expect the efficacy of Ordinances ſhould be continued, while you neglect the means, which the Lord hath appointed, and commended to you, as moſt effectual for the continuance thereof? The bleſſing of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances will not abide upon him, who continues in ſin, eſpecially when his ſin, is the neglect of that <hi>medium,</hi> which ſhould fixe the bleſſing upon him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let the efficacy of the Ordinances be purſued preſently into act, if they convince you of any neglected duty, fall immediately upon the practiſe of it. If they make you more reſolute, againſt any carnal or worldly luſt, betake your ſelves preſently to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of it. If they kindle any holy affection to Chriſt or his people, give ſome real expreſſion thereof without delay. If they revive any languiſhing grace, let it be forthwith exerciſed. This was <hi>Davids</hi> practice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 60. you will finde this one of the beſt expedients, for the fixing and ſecuring of thoſe good motions, which are raiſed in your mindes and hearts by the Ordinances. When the bloſſoms of a fruit-tree are once knit, though the flouriſh thereof be gone, and you ſee nothing but the bare rudiment of the expected fruit; yet you think it more ſecured from the injury of froſts and winds, than if it were ſtill in the flower; good motions when they are once reduced into act, are thereby as it were knit, and brought to more conſiſtency. They are then well paſt one of their critical periods, where moſt miſcarry, and ſo are more like to live, and continue with you. Beſides the act ſtrengthens that good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſpoſition which leads to it, and ſo makes you more ready for another act and that diſpoſeth to more acts, and thoſe to better, and repeated acts beget a habit, and this (as the Philoſopher
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:46545:329"/> tells us) is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſomething that will ſtay by you. The hearts of the people being raiſed by <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> zealous ſpeech, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. they were kept up in that poſture, till the work deſigned by him was finiſhed (till Religion was reſtored and reformed) and how came this to paſs? Why, <hi>the thing was done ſuddenly,</hi> verſ. 36. he purſued the peoples good inclinations, and brought them into act ſuddenly, he ſtruck while the iron was hot. When your hearts are heated by the Ordinances, ſet immediately upon your work; the <hi>primus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi> affords a great advantage if it be improved, poſſibly in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of it, you may overcome thoſe great dfficulties and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have been too hard for you formerly, and may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe give you impediment hereafter, and this being maſtered, your progreſs will be eaſier, you may go on towards heaven under the power of the Ordinances, with leſs interruption and fewer inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of theſe divine influences, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22.23. <hi>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers onely, deceiving your own ſelves, for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer, i. e.</hi> if he do it not preſently, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what follows) <hi>he is like to a man beholding his natural face in a glaſs; for he beholdeth himſelf, and goeth his way, and ſtreight way forgetteth what manner of man he was.</hi> The glaſs diſcovers what ſpots and ſullages are in his face, that he may waſh them off, or what is diſordered about him, that he may correct and compoſe it; but if he do not this preſently, if he put it off till ſome occurence, divert him from the thoughts and remembrance of it, his looking in the mirror, will prove but a loſs of time, a vain curioſity. Your uſe of the Ordinances is like to prove no better, if you practiſe not what they lead you to without delay, its like to be no other, than ſuch a viewing of your ſelves in a glaſs, a meer fruitleſs ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You muſt take much pains with your hearts, if you would have them retain the vertue and efficacy of the Ordinances. The effect of them ſhould be as a nail faſtned in a ſure place, but the heart is ſo hard and knotty a piece that you cannot drive it in without many blows; it will require all your ſtrength to force it in far enough, and all your care and watchfulneſs to keep it in when it is there. They groſly miſtake Chriſtianity, who take it to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with our carnal eaſe and ſlothfulneſs, who place it in notions or opinions, in fair ſhews, and a ſpecious profeſſion, in forms, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, or external obſervances, in conforming to this or that mode
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:46545:329"/> of Worſhip or Diſcipline. It were well for the World if one could be a Chriſtian at ſuch an eaſie rate; but they that pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch conceits, they erre not knowing the Scriptures. The action of a Chriſtian is all along in the New Teſtament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by ſtriving, wreſtling, running and combating, exerciſes, wherein he that will not be worſted, muſt intend all his ſpirits, ſtretch all his ſinews, put forth all his ſtrength; he that is a Chriſtian indeed, he muſt <gap reason="foreign">

The power and life of holineſs can neither be attained, nor upheld, without an effectual uſe of the Ordinances; the Ordinances will never be effectual to purpoſe, unleſs the vertue of them abide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart; now it meets with ſuch reluctancy and oppoſition from the heart (ſo far as it is unrenewed) that it can never be faſtned there, without ſtriving and ſtrugling and earneſt contending, it muſt be done in deſpight of our own eaſe, and carnal humours and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination, and all the reſiſtance of the body of death. If you think this too much you think much to be Chriſtians indeed, however you pretend to the name. Thoſe that are acquainted with their own hearts finde it very hard to get them raiſed to a ſpiritual and heavenly temper, very difficult to get them pullied up (though they have the advantage of the moſt powerfull Ordinances) to any good poſture; and when with much ado they are got up, exceeding difficult to keep them there. Alas we ſeem to be forcing a weighty ſtone up a ſteep hill, when with much toyl we have got it near the top, take but our hands off a little, leave it but to it ſelf; and down it runs further in a moment, than we can get it up again in ſome hours. Our way to heaven lyes up the hill, that which is ſpiritual and heavenly is above us, the natural bent and tendency of our hearts is downwards; as there is no getting them up without toyl and pains, ſo when we have raiſed them a little, leave them but to themſelves, grow but a little remiſs and negligent, and down they run on a ſudden, we ſhall quickly finde them at the bottome of the hill, in a carnal, lukewarm earthly temper. When our hearts are effectually touched and raiſed, and moved in the uſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, there's no keeping them in a quick and lively motion, without ſtriving and ſtrugling, and as it were forcing them on with might and main. The influence of the Ordinances falling upon a
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:46545:330"/> ſloathfull ſoul is quite loſt, and meerly thrown away upon it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.27. <hi>The ſloathful man roaſteth not that which he took in hunting.</hi> So he loſeth all his former labour becauſe he will not take a little more pains; a ſloathfull ſoul loſeth all the advantages he gets by following the Ordinances, for want of care and induſtry to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and improve what he hath gotten.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Comply with the Spirit of God. Theſe influences both as to the riſe and continuance of them are from him. When you comply not with him, you grieve the Spirit, and provoke him to withdraw; and when he withdraws, theſe influences will be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. If you detain the truth in unrighteouſneſs, if you confine it to your mindes, ſo as the power thereof deſcends not upon your hearts and affections, comes not forth in your lives and actions, you do <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, impriſon the truth, and that is a great affront to the Spirit of Truth. If when the Spirit of God calls you to take up the Croſs, to leave all to follow Chriſt contentedly and cheerfully in a low reproached afflicted condition; or if when he calls you up to a higher degree of ſelf-denial, mortification and holineſs; you hang back, or turn aſide, and refuſe to follow his conduct, this grieves the Spirit of holineſs. If you decline his inſtitutions for other devices, ſhrink back from the work you are engaged to, when it grows hazardous; ſtrain your conſciences to ſecure your outward enjoyments, will not be influenced by him, further than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with your eaſe, credit, ſafety and worldly intereſt, you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour the Spirit of wiſdome. This provokes the bleſſed Spirit to withdraw, and when the fire is gone, the heat will not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. If you refuſe to continue under the influences of the Spirit in ſome things, its righteous with him not to continue them upon you in others. If you fear the diſpleaſure of man more than the grieving of him, if you lean more to the hopes of this life, than his ſupports, and conſult with fleſh and blood inſtead of being directed by the wiſdome which is from above; it will be no wonder if he give you over to your own conduct, and intermitting his own, leave you under the influences of your carnall fears, and worldly hopes.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Be frequent in the uſe of Ordinances, good impreſſions do moſt uſually wear off in the intervals of holy duties, and the longer theſe are, the more danger there is, therefore make theſe interims as ſhort as may be by quick returns to the Ordinances. It
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:46545:330"/> is obſerved that places under the line are not ſo hot, as ſome cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates at a further diſtance from it; &amp; this reaſon is given for it, thoſe under the equinoctial, though they have the Sun more vertical, and the beams falling perpendicularly, cauſe a more intenſe heat; yet the nights being of equal length with the dayes, the coolneſs of thoſe long nights doth more allay the heat than where the nights are ſhorter. Long intermiſſions of holy duties are like long nights, you may finde them by experience to be great coolers; if you live under more powerfull Ordinances, than ſome others, yet if they be more frequent and diligent in the uſe of what they have, they are like to have more ſpiritual warmth than you, and that with leſs allay and intermiſſion. Beſides when the advantage you have got by one Ordinance is declining and wearing off; the uſe of the ſame, or of ſome other, may revive and recover it, if you take it ſpeedily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too far gone. Further, a ſlieght impreſſion, ſuch as is not like to laſt long, may be re inforced for a longer continuance, if you lay your ſelves quickly under the inſtrument that firſt made it. When <hi>Elijah</hi> had once taſted of the proviſion the Lord made for him in the Wilderneſs he <hi>laid him down</hi> ſaith the Text, as having enough; but the Angel calls him to it again, for ſaith he, <hi>The journey is too great for thee,</hi> 1 King. 19.6, 7. Hereupon he aroſe once more, and did eat and drink, and <hi>went in the ſtrength of that meat forty dayes, and forty nights,</hi> verſ. 8. Once taſting will not ſerve your turn, a little will not be enough, ſo long a journey as yours is will ſpend much; nothing but a frequent, an often repeated uſe of the Ordinances will furniſh you with ſuch ſtrength as will laſt you many dayes.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Finally, Look up to God for the continuance of this influence, pray, and pray in faith. Seek him and depend on him for it, <hi>He will be found of thoſe that ſeek him,</hi> Matth. 7.7. You have his promiſe for it and dependance on him, obliegeth him too, <hi>the expectation of the poor ſhall not periſh,</hi> Pſal. 9.18. it is not for his honour to fail thoſe, whom he hath incouraged to rely on him; an ingenuous man will not do it, much leſſe the faithfull God.

What greater incouragement can we have to deſire this of God, than that he expreſſeth himſelf deſirous we ſhould have it? Faith is the main ſtrength of prayer, and the great ſupports of faith are theſe two, that <hi>he is able,</hi> and that <hi>he is willing.</hi> Theſe are to faith like the two pillars of the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.21. and the names of them (there expreſſed) are very appoſite. <hi>He ſet up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin,</hi> i. e. he <hi>will</hi> eſtabliſh, <hi>he is willing;</hi> and <hi>he ſet up the laſt pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz,</hi> i. e. in him is ſtrength, <hi>he is able.</hi> Now faith hath both theſe pillars to ſupport it in this buſineſſe, that the Lord is able to continue his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, you will not queſtion I hope, <hi>He is able to do exceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly above all we ask or think, according to the power which worketh in us,</hi> Epheſ. 3.20. and that <hi>he is willing,</hi> he puts it out of queſtion, when he uſeth ſuch an expreſſion, as amongſt men, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, a paſſionate deſire. O that there were ſuch a heart in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now (ſaith the Philoſopher) <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, &amp;c. that which one is both able and willing to do, ſhall be done. Both reaſon and faith ſee ground enough to conclude this. Pray then, and pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, for as the Lord is able to do it, ſo it is according to his will, and whatſoever you ask according to his will, believing, it ſhall be done, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.22.</p>
            <p>Thus much for what you are to practice, there are ſome things to be avoided, if you would have the influence of the Ordinances to be laſting, theſe we ſhall comprize in four particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Take heed you perform not holy duties negligently, a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, formal, negligent attendance on the Ordinances, will be ſo farre from procuring a durable bleſſing, that it will fix a curſe upon you, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.10. <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of tht Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,</hi> ſee <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.8, 14. If you invert the Apoſtles advice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. and deal with the things of God, as you ſhould do, with thoſe of the world. If you pray as though you prayed not, and hear as though you heard not, and uſe the Ordinances as though you did not uſe them: they will be no otherwiſe effectual, than if there were no efficacy in them, it will continue on you as though it continued
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:46545:331"/> not; like that of the Sun in a Winter day, which thaws the earth a little at noon, but ſo as it is harder frozen up the next night. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let your hearts be ingaged in every holy duty, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Who is this that ingaged his heart to approach unto me.</hi> You muſt hear as for life, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46, 47. <hi>Set your hearts unto all the words which I teſtifie among you this day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For it is not a vain thing for you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is your life,</hi> &amp;c. you muſt wreſtle in prayer, your hearts in this duty ſhould be as it were in a conflict, in an agony, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> will be a prayer full of the holy Ghoſt, wherein that bleſſed Spirit is operative, exerting its force and <hi>energy.</hi> Such a prayer as ſhews the ſoul to be poſſeſſed of the holy Spirit and acted by it, ſo as all the powers of that ſoul are ſet a work, and put upon motion towards God <hi>effectually.</hi> Such a prayer <hi>availes much,</hi> procures great advantages, and of long continuance.</p>
            <p>Generally in all holy Ordinances your ſouls ſhould ſtretch out themſelves to reach the Lord, they ſhould ſpring up to him in acts of love and deſire, and claſpe about him with delight and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and lay hold on him with a humble and filial confidence, and ſtir up themſelves to lay hold on him. We do all fade as a leafe ſaith the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. (both their perſons and their righteouſneſſe did ſo) and the reaſon thereof follows <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>There is none that ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up himſelf to take hold on thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Beware of the world, meddle not with it more than needs muſt; and when it is needfull ingage not therein, but with fear, caution and vigilance. Carry your ſelves amongſt worldly objects and employments, as though you were amongſt cheats and thieves: they have the art to pick your heart ſlily, and to rob them of that which is more precious than Gold, when you little think of it.</p>
            <p>Let not your minds and hearts plunge themſelves in the world: nothing ſooner, nothing oftner, extinguiſheth divine influences
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:46545:332"/> than this puddle. The cares, and delights, and employments of the world, when they are immoderate or unſeaſonable, <hi>they choak</hi> the Word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.22. they ſtifle the iſſue of holy Ordinances, ſo as it becomes like the untimely birth of a woman.</p>
            <p>When your hearts are warmed in holy duties, you ſhould be as cautious and wary how you venture into the world; as you are of going into the froſty aire, when you are all in a ſweat. What is kindled by the Word or Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how quickly is it puft out by the world, when you ruſh into it unwarily? it requires as much care to keep it in, as to keep a Candle in, when you would carry it through the open aire in a rainy bluſtring night. The further you are above the world, the longer may you retain any ſpirituall impreſſions. Geographers write of ſome Mountains whoſe tops are above the middle Region of the Air; and there lines and figures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn in the duſt, have been found (ſay they) in the ſame form and order, untouched, undefaced a long time after: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe they are above thoſe winds, and ſhowres, and ſtorms, which ſoon wear out, and efface any ſuch draughts in this lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The lower your minds and hearts and converſations are, the more in the hurry of this boyſterous world, the leſſe will any thing that is heavenly and ſpiritual abide upon them. Let the ſoul be brought into never ſo good order, by the help of holy duties: yet a little unwary ingaging in earthly buſineſſe will ruffle, diſturb and quite diſcompoſe it.</p>
            <p>When your ſouls are by the power of the Ordinance ſet on mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards Chriſt and Heaven; if you would hold on in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſe, you muſt beware of worldlineſſe, and keep free as much as may be from earthly incumbrances and intanglements, <hi>Let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſinne which doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run with patience the race that is ſet before us,</hi> Heb. 12.1. Let us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere and hold out in that gracious and heavenly courſe, which the Goſpel hath put us on: but that this may be done, one great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment muſt be removed, <hi>The ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us muſt be ſhaken off.</hi> Now that ſin as ſome Expoſitors conceive, is world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and it is probable for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> being a circumſtance <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, if we render it literally, is the ſin that hath goodly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. And no ſin ſets off it ſelf with more goodly circumſtances than worldlineſſe, no ſinne hath more ſpecious pleas and pretences to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, vindicate and juſtifie it ſelf. No ſin hath more fig leaves to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:46545:332"/> its nakedneſſe, and to ſhrowd it from diſcovery and conviction than worldlineſſe. This muſt be ſhaken off, it is the great defacer of heavenly impreſſions, the chief interrupter of holy motions: if you would hold on, when the <hi>impetus</hi> which is impreſt on you by any Ordinance, hath ſet you a going; beware of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of worldlineſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Take heed of any inordinacy in affection, inclination or deſign. Such inordinacies give the heart a ſtrong bias, holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties check it but a little, give it but as it were a ſmall rub: when this is once paſt over, it will hold on, in that courſe to which it is moſt ſweyed. The Mniſtery of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had ſome influence upon <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, He heard John gladly, and did many things,</hi> Mark 6.20. but ſenſuality being predominant, thoſe better inclinations were quite overpowred. The word had ſome effect upon <hi>Simon Magus, He believed,</hi> Act. 8.13. and being taken for a believer <hi>was baptized,</hi> and afterwards <hi>continued with Philip,</hi> &amp;c. but a ſtrong affectation of vain-glory ſuppreſſed thoſe better motions, and the worſt got up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. Take heed of any inordinacy as to lawfull things, your rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſtudies, ordinary callings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this will not not ſuffer you to come ſo often to holy duties, to ſtay ſo long in them, or to be ſo intent upon them, as is requiſite for the deep impreſſing of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy: and after they are done, this will hurry your ſouls from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe thoughts and exerciſes, which ſhould fix and ſettle their virtue and influence upon your minds and hearts. Natural bodies follow the tendency of that element which is predominant in them, a ſtone moves downwards, it would be at the centre; that which ſtops it, offers it violence, and when the force is removed, down it fals freely. Juſt thus doth the heart follow the tendency of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ordinacies, if it meet with a ſtop in an Ordinance, that's but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull violence to it; it will ſtruggle to break through it, will be reſtleſſe till the force be removed, till the power of the Ordinance be ſhaken off, which checks an inclination natural and acceptable to it, and what hopes in this caſe, that the efficacy of any holy duty will long continue?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Reſt not in the beſt performance of any duty, nor in any aſſiſtances you find therein, though they be ſpecial and more than ordinary. If this ſatisfie and exalt you, you will be apt to grow ſecure and careleſſe, not looking to the improvement of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces when once they are over, and that's the way to loſe all. We
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:46545:333"/> are apt to take the moſt dangerous colds, when we are in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heats. And its obſerved that ſome profeſſors have had the fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fals, after they have been moſt elevated, in holy imployments. The reſting upon the <hi>opus operatum</hi> the meer outward performance of a duty, when the heart is not ingaged therein, is an open pit, which none fall into, ſave thoſe that are blind: but the reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>opus operantis</hi> a duty affectionately performed, is a more ſecret, and ſo a more dangerous ſnare. He that makes account he hath done enough, becauſe he hath done well; may be apt to think he is not obliged to look further after it: and ſo the continued influence of the duty upon his heart and life, which is indeed the principal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, may be neglected, and conſequently loſt for want of looking to.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Make not the Ordinances your end, but uſe them as the means to attain it. They are not injoyned us for themſelves, but in order to ſomething more deſirable, their end is ſomething further than their uſe. Take heed you place not all your Religion, in hearing, praying, communicating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither count your ſelves religious enough, becauſe you are much and often in theſe duties. This is to make them your end, and then you will reſt therein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proceeding further (for the motion of the Agent is terminated in his end:) and ſo you will ſtay ſhort of that, for which they were principally intended, <hi>viz.</hi> the keeping of your hearts and minds in a ſetled poſture of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe: and neglect that, by which this main end of the Ordinances is onely to be attained, <hi>viz.</hi> the continuing of their influence upon you.</p>
            <p>So much for the caſe propounded, which I have indeavoured to reſolve (as the nature of it requires) practically: and therefore as there is no time for, ſo there will be leſſe need of Application. But that I may not diſmiſſe you without ſomething of this nature, having laid your duty before you in the Obſervation, and ſhewed you how it may be performed in ſatisfying the caſe: Let me now preſſe you to the performance of it by one Conſideration, which will have the force of a Motive, where there is any ſenſe of ſoul-concernments.</p>
            <p>If the efficacy of the Ordinances abide not on you, you cannot be fruitfull under them, at leaſt you cannot <hi>bring forth fruit unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> (as the expreſſion is <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14.) you may bring forth buds, or leaves, or bloſſomes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if their influence continue not, that which you bring forth will never come to ripeneſſe and <hi>perfection;</hi>
               <pb n="693" facs="tcp:46545:333"/> it will be crude and ſowr at beſt, and ſowr Grapes are as bad as no fruit in the Lords account: and unfruitfullneſſe will provoke the Lord to deprive you of the Goſpel and Ordinances, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5.2, 5, 6. <hi>Ye looked that it ſhould bring forth Grapes, and it brought forth wild Grapes. — And now go to, I will tell you what I will do to my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. I will take away the hedge thereof. —I will lay it waſte that it ſhall not be pruned nor digged. —I will alſo command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</hi> The meaning of this parable (ſo farre as concerns our purpoſe) is expreſſed by another threatning, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the ſame ſin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43. <hi>The kingdome of God (i. e.</hi> the Goſpel of the kingdome) <hi>ſhall be taken from you, and given to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> And Chriſts threatning of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> amounts to as much, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>Nevertheleſſe I have ſomething againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love.</hi> The firſt impreſſions of the Goſpel were worn off and vaniſhed. And what follows, <hi>I will come againſt thee quickly, and remove thy Candleſtick out of its place, unleſſe thou repent.</hi> So that this ſin will pull up your hedge, and break down your wall, level all your ſecurities; and ſo lay you open to the boar of the wood, and the wild beaſts of the field: ſuch as inſtead of digging and pruning you, will devour and lay you waſt, and <hi>Sharon</hi> will become a deſart. This ſin will provoke Chriſt to let the Stars fall out of his right hand: ſo as you will be left to periſh for want of viſion. This ſin will provoke the Lord to take the Goſpel of the Kingdome from you: and leave you under the helliſh influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Prince of darkneſſe. This ſin will overturn your Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, and extinguiſh your lights, and leave you nothing but the ſnuffs. This ſin will deliver your ſtrength into captivity, and your glory into the enemies hand. This ſin will ſmite the ſhepheards and ſcatter the flocks, and lay the heritage of God deſolate. This ſinne will cauſe your Sun to ſet at noon, and turn the day of your gracious viſitation, into a ſad and diſmal night. This ſin will turn the place which hath been a valley of viſion, into a ſeat of darkneſſe, and a <hi>valley of the ſhadow of death.</hi>
